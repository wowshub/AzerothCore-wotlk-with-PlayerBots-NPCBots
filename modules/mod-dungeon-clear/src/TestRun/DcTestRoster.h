// Pure parser for `.dc test start <dungeon> party=Tank,Heal,Dps1,Dps2,Dps3`:
// the hand-picked-party form of a test run, where real player characters take
// the five slots instead of randomly drawn addclass-pool bots.
//
// Roles are POSITIONAL — slot 0 tank, slot 1 healer, slots 2-4 dps — mirroring
// the DcTestRunJob::_slots convention (slot 0 is the group leader and the run's
// tank). There is no per-name role syntax on purpose: the Command Deck's roster
// builder emits the order, and a positional list is the one form that cannot
// disagree with itself.
//
// Engine-free (names in, names out) so the grammar and its refusals are
// unit-testable in isolation, the same shape as DcTestRunSelect. Turning names
// into guids, and every liveness/faction check, belongs to the caller — this
// only decides whether the string is a well-formed roster.

    // Split on commas, trim each name, assign positional roles. Rejects an empty
    // list, a list that isn't exactly five names, and a repeated name (compared
    // case-insensitively — WoW names are unique up to case, so "Bob,bob" is one
    // character asked to fill two slots, which would deadlock the group build).
