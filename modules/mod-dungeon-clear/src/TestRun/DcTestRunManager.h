// Registry of live `.dc test` runs. Each run is a DcTestRunJob owning its own
// 5-bot party, instance, watchdog and record; the manager only launches jobs,
// ticks them, routes the two observer callbacks to the right job by tank guid,
// arbitrates the shared bot pool, and writes the one multi-run live-status file
// the dashboard polls. Any number of runs execute at once — uncapped by default
// (DungeonClear.TestRun.MaxConcurrent, 0 = unlimited), so the real ceiling is
// the addclass pool (a start with no free character for a comp slot is refused
// by name) and the machine. AiPlayerbot.MaxAddedBots does not apply: the
// harness's own adds are exempt from it (DcTestRunJob::Create).
//
// Threading rules:
//   * _runs is mutated ONLY on the world thread (Start push_back, Tick erase)
//     but read by observer callbacks that fire from map-update threads. Lock
//     _runsMutex in: Start's push_back, Tick's erase pass, and both observer
//     callbacks for the lookup PLUS the forwarded call (so a job can't be
//     erased out from under a map thread mid-callback). WriteLiveStatus locks
//     it while gathering per-job snapshots. World-thread reads (Tick iteration,
//     StatusText, Stop, cap/budget checks in Start) need no lock.
//   * _reservedGuids and _provisionRR are world-thread only.
//   * Each job owns its own _obsMutex for its observer-written fields, so N
//     runs' observers never contend with each other.
