// Pure builder for the live-heartbeat sidecar the dashboard polls
// (dc_testrun_live.json). With concurrent runs and plans the file carries:
//
//   {"active":<bool>,"ts":<unixS>,"plans":[ {…per-plan keys…}, … ],
//    "runs":[ {…per-run keys…}, … ]}
//
// "active" is true whenever at least one run OR plan is present (a plan in a
// between-runs backoff window with zero children is still active); the
// dashboard treats a stale ts (or active:false) as "no live run". Keys are
// only ever added, so an older app.js keeps rendering the runs array
// unchanged. Engine-free (takes plain snapshots the managers gather under
// their own locks) so the schema is unit-testable in isolation.
