/*
 * mod-dungeon-clear — DcSettingsRegistry.h
 *
 * The single source of truth for every DungeonClear tunable. Each row pairs a
 * config key with its type, default, clamp range, and whether players may
 * override it from the companion addon. Everything else — the conf default
 * lookup, the validation/clamping of client-supplied overrides, and (if the
 * addon panel is schema-driven) the UI controls — derives from this table.
 *
 * Adding a new option later is a one-line change here plus the matching line in
 * mod_dungeon_clear.conf.dist; read it at the use site via DcSettings::GetT().
 * Never reach past this table to sConfigMgr — a raw GetOption re-logs "Config:
 * Missing property ..." on every call, which floods Server.log from any per-tick
 * call site. tools/check_config_reads.py fails the build if one creeps back in.
 *
 * The `key` is the suffix only — the "DungeonClear." prefix is added by the
 * accessor when it falls back to sConfigMgr.
