/*
 * mod-dungeon-clear — DcSettings.h
 *
 * Accessor for DungeonClear tunables. Resolution order on every read:
 *
 *     per-run override
 *       ->  conf "DungeonClear.<Key>.Raid"     |  raid maps only
 *       ->  registry raidVal                   |
 *       ->  conf "DungeonClear.<Key>.Heroic"   |  heroic-tier maps only
 *       ->  registry heroicVal                 |
 *       ->  conf "DungeonClear.<Key>"
 *       ->  registry default
 *
 * The two heroic steps apply only while the reading bot's map is heroic-tier
 * (Map::IsHeroic — never a raw difficulty compare, which collides with 25-man
 * normal), and only for rows that opt in (a "<Key>.Heroic" conf line, or a
 * non-sentinel `heroicVal` in the registry). The two raid steps sit above them
 * and apply on any raid map, for rows with a "<Key>.Raid" line or a registry
 * `raidVal` — the raid profile is the handful of numbers that must scale with
 * 10-40 members (spread, recovery budgets). A row that opts out of both layers
 * — nearly all of them — resolves through the identical code path it did before
 * the layers existed, everywhere. Heroic trash is a different game from
 * normal trash (every mob elite, packs that end a run), and the pull safety
 * profile has to change with it; everything else stays one value.
 *
 * The override deliberately sits ABOVE the heroic layer and is itself
 * difficulty-blind: a human who typed a value for this run means it for this
 * run, and a default — however well chosen for heroic — must never overrule an
 * explicit one.
 *
 * The per-run override layer is keyed by the run's leader-tank GUID
 * (DcLeaderSignal::FindLeaderTank), so each dungeon run can carry its own
 * settings pushed from the companion addon while the conf file stays the
 * server-wide default. The override layer is uncached, so an override applied
 * mid-run takes effect on the next tick with no reload.
 *
 * Two things protect the worldserver console / CPU from these per-tick reads:
 *
 *   1. Every conf read passes showLogs=false (see ConfValueUncached), so the
 *      core never emits its "Config: Missing property ..." warning. Every DC
 *      tunable is optional — the registry holds the authoritative default, so a
 *      missing conf line is normal operation, not an error worth logging once
 *      per tick per bot. This is the definitive spam fix.
 *
 *   2. The conf layer (the fallback when a key has no override) is cached in one
 *      process-wide table — populated ONCE (at startup / on `.reload config`),
 *      not per map-update thread — so a read avoids the config-map lookup /
 *      getenv() / string churn GetOption does on every call, and warmup costs
 *      ~one resolution per key total rather than that many times the (high)
 *      MapUpdate.Threads pool size. Re-populated on `.reload config` via
 *      InvalidateConfCache below, so edited values still take effect live.
 *
 * Only player-facing registry rows consult the override store; server-only rows
 * (e.g. PathCenter*) go straight to conf, which keeps them safe to read from the
 * map-update worker threads that run corridor centering.
 *
 * See DcSettingsRegistry.h for the setting table.
