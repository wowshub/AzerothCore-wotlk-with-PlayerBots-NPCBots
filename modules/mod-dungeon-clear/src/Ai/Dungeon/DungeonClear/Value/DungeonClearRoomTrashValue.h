// "dungeon clear room trash remaining": the alive, attackable hostiles that
// must be cleared BEFORE pulling a room-aggro boss (RoomAggroRegistry). The set
// is everything within the boss's scripted room radius — minus the boss, any
// other encounter boss, and anything glued so tightly to the boss it can't be
// pulled without waking it (the boss-aggro sphere) — that the tank can actually
// reach with no closed door between. Empty when the next boss isn't flagged, the
// boss isn't loaded, the room is clear, or the room-clear was given up on
// (RoomClearTimeout). The driving gate (DungeonClearAtBossTrigger) holds the
// boss pull while this is non-empty; the pull pipeline / room-clear action
// target the nearest member.
//
// 500ms poll (mirrors "dungeon clear far targets", whose result it filters). The
// give-up timeout state lives as members on the long-lived value object and
// self-resets when the boss changes or the run ends, so it needs no external
// reset wiring.
