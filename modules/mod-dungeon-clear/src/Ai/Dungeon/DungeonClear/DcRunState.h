// The authoritative, leader-owned state of one dungeon-clear RUN — the run's
// identity/mode, its current manual-override objective, and the two cross-bot
// leader-fight signals that used to live in translation-unit-static maps. Owned
// as a single value (DungeonClearRunStateValue, "dungeon clear run state") so the
// whole run resets in lockstep through named transitions, exactly like the
// sub-feature structs DcApproachState and DcPullContext already do one level down.
//
// This is the third and last of the "one struct, one Reset()" consolidations that
// each ended a recurring "the X is flaky" family. DcApproachState fixed the
// approach FSM; DcPullContext fixed the pull FSM; DcRunState fixes the PARTY/RUN
// level — the enabled/paused/pause-cluster/selected-boss values whose resets were
// hand-replicated (as slightly different subsets) across DisableDungeonClear and
// the DcOn/Off/Skip/Go/Resume chat-action clusters, plus the leader-combat-since
// and party-engaged latches that were file-static maps each with their own mutex.
// A stale latch surviving a pause / skip / resume / boss-change was the single
// most common root cause in the whole bug log; folding these here so exactly one
// Reset() clears them makes that class structurally impossible.
//
// Add a new run-level field HERE (never as a separate value) so it can never be
// forgotten by a reset.
//
// Leader-owned. Followers read `enabled`/`paused` cross-context through the
// leader's copy of this value (DcLeaderSignal::IsInPausedDungeonClearRun and the
// party-tank / camp-hold gates), the same pattern DcPullContext uses. Each bot
// still holds its OWN DcRunState value; a follower's stays at defaults (it never
// leads a run) and reading it is harmless.
//
// NOTE on the pull PREFERENCE: the advanced-pull tri-state (`dungeon clear pull
// setting`) and its behavioral bool (`dungeon clear pull mode`) are deliberately
// NOT folded in here. Their lifetime is the odd one out — the preference is
// settable BEFORE a run and must survive the disabled window to be applied by
// `dc on`, and toggling it live is coupled to daze-immunity + camp-seed side
// effects (DungeonClearChatActions::ApplyPullSetting). They are already funneled
// through ApplyPullSetting / DisableDungeonClear and are excluded from every
// blanket reset anyway, so folding them here would add surface without any
// reset-safety gain. They stay as their own values.
// One key/value an event hands the test harness for its run record (see
// DcRunState::SetTestExtra). `numeric` values are written to the record's JSON
// as bare numbers, everything else as strings.

    //
    // The conductor's block on the RUN OWNER and each member's own half on every
    // bot — see DcChessRunState (Util/DcChessConductor.h). Cleared by ClearChess
    // when a finished game has to be played again, and by Reset().
    DcChessRunState chess;

    // === test-harness telemetry (leader-owned; SURVIVES Reset) ====================
    // The seam between a long scripted event and the `.dc test` harness
    // (Karazhan chess plan, T1). Both fields are written by the event on the RUN
    // OWNER's DcRunState (the leader; the harness's tank) and only ever read by
    // DcTestRunJob — nothing in the clear itself reacts to them, so an ordinary
    // (non-test) run pays two stores per event step and nothing else.
    //
    // WHY THEY SURVIVE Reset(): the run's own success path is DisableDungeonClear,
    // which Reset()s this struct, and the harness only samples at 1 Hz. A value
    // wiped in the same tick the event completed would never reach the record —
    // exactly the final `looted` / `gameTimeS` the record exists to carry. So
    // Reset() carries this block across, and the harness clears it explicitly
    // (ClearTestTelemetry) before it issues `dc on`, which is the one boundary a
    // test run's telemetry actually belongs to.
    //
    // eventProgressSeq — the EVENT PROGRESS SEQUENCE. A counter a running DC
    // event bumps (BumpEventProgress) whenever it makes real headway that the
    // harness cannot see for itself: chess bumps it on each accepted move, each
    // piece death and each phase change. The harness treats a CHANGE in it
    // exactly like a boss kill or an anchor clear — it resets the no-progress
    // clock — so a ten-minute game with no kills and no anchor movement is not
    // failed as a livelock. Only the change matters (the harness compares it to
    // the last value it saw), so wrap-around is harmless. Any future long event
    // can use the same counter; bump it on genuine progress only, never on a
    // timer, or it blinds the livelock net it is exempting the event from.
    //
    // testExtras — a flat key/value map the event fills for the run record
    // (schema 13 `extras`): chess writes attempts, losses, gameTimeS, restarts,
    // material, cheat counts, controllerChurn, looted. Setting an existing key
    // overwrites it in place (insertion order is kept for the record), so an
    // event can simply re-publish its counters on every change. Keep it small —
    // it is copied into the harness once a second.
