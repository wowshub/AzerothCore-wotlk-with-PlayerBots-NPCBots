    // on every tank and healer, and a priest single-target buffing thirty-nine
    // people is a healer who is never at full mana. The gate stayed down, the
    // engage action never ran, and every budget the muster owns — which is only
    // ever compared against getMSTime() on a tick that EVALUATES it — was never
    // sampled. Live at Vaelastrasz (2026-08-28, five 40-mans, 60s ceiling): the

    //     ALLOWED BY ITS OWN AI TO ATTACK US.
    //
    // Keying on reachability — not distance — is the safety property: a pursuer in a
    // flee or kite is always path-reachable (that is how it chases and how the party
    // fled from it), so it always counts as resolvable and the escape hatch stays
    // inert. Only a holder the bot genuinely cannot path to (spawned behind a closed
    // gate / across a navmesh gap) fails the test — exactly the ghost-flag case.
    //
    // CanAIAttack is the second, independent way a holder can be unable to resolve,
    // and reachability cannot see it. A boss whose script gates its own aggro on
    // GEOMETRY reads as alive, non-evading and perfectly path-reachable while being
    // permanently incapable of touching us. Selin Fireheart is the case
    // (`CanAIAttack(who) { return who->GetPositionX() > 216.0f; }`): pull his guard
    // pack out to the scripted camp at X=170 and he gets linked into the fight, then
    // holds the whole party in a combat reference he can never act on and never
    // resolves. Live in tr-20260803-211838-7 — three members flagged by Selin from
    // 62-74yd, everyone at 100% HP, `attackers=0 victim=-`, phase wedged at Engage
    // for 334 seconds until the run was declared frozen:
    //
    //   Xomja held by Selin Fireheart(24723) 62.9yd 100% reachable CANNOT-ATTACK-ME

    // The teardown snapshot has been PRINTING that CANNOT-ATTACK-ME field for a while
    // (DcDiagSnapshot::CaptureCombatHolders) precisely because reachability could not
    // explain these holders; it just was not wired into the verdict. Now it is.
    //
    // Narrow by construction, and deliberately not the "no progress while in combat ->
    // force-clear" hatch that was tried and reverted at S1187: this asks the holder's
    // OWN script whether the fight is possible, so an ordinary mob (UnitAI's default,
    // and SmartAI's override, both return true unconditionally) can never trip it. The
    // caller's other guards still apply on top — no attackers, no victim, not a raid,
    // and the phantom state has to hold continuously for StuckCombatTimeout — so a
    // boss that merely gates attacks during an intro or a phase transition rearms the
    // clock instead of being cleared.
    // `nearestDist` reports the distance to the CLOSEST legitimate holder, so the
