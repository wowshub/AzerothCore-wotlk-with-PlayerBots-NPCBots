// Engine glue for post-combat party resurrection (see DcRezDecision.h for the
// kernel semantics). This is the only place the feature touches game objects:
// it resolves the run owner, snapshots the same-map group (KEEPING dead
// members), reads the settings via DcSettings, stamps/clears the recovery
// clock on the owner's DcRunState, runs the pure kernel, and emits the
// (deduped) party-chat announcements.
//
// RUN-OWNER RESOLUTION IS DEAD-TOLERANT. DcLeaderSignal::FindLeaderTank only
// elects among ALIVE tank bots, so when the leader itself is the corpse the
// election returns null (or a different tank whose own run state is default).
// Recovery must keep working exactly then — a healer follower has to walk over
// and raise its tank — so ResolveRunOwner falls back to scanning the same-map
// group for the member whose OWN DcRunState is enabled (the run owner), dead
// or alive. All clocks/announce stamps live on that owner's run state and are
// written cross-bot (the same single-threaded access DcSmartRest relies on),
// dying with DcRunState::Reset() automatically.
