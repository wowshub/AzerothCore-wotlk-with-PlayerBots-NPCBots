// sync" — kept aligned only by hand. Centralizing them here makes drift
// impossible: one definition, every site includes it.

// Phase 1 of the constant-centralization refactor only houses the previously

// Bucket-A consolidation and Bucket-B promotion to DcSettings are later phases.

// effectively file-global via the old anonymous-namespace defs) so call sites
// stay unqualified and unchanged.

// _USE_MATH_DEFINES is set BEFORE the first inclusion of math.h, and any TU that

// gets them — that is the "M_PI: undeclared identifier" build break on MSVC, and
// its cascade inside Position.h ("fmod: no overloaded function takes 1
// arguments", from the argument that failed to compile). The module's CMake also

// "At most this many ticks of extra travel" is only true because TryBetweenPullsRest

// with nothing running would let the ladder launch a fresh 35-38yd escort window on a
// debounce tick — five seconds of committed travel bought with a three-tick grace, and
// unbounded travel if the ready/not-ready flicker repeats. See the note there.
