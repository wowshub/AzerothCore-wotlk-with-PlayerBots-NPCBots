    // --- Raid / multi-tank leadership ---------------------------------------
    // Elects the single tank that drives the clear for the whole group. A party
    // has one tank, but a raid can have several (one per sub-group); without a
    // single elected leader every tank would try to drive and each sub-group's
    // members would trail their own tank instead of one raid leader. The
    // candidate set is the alive tank BOTS on `reference`'s map (real-player
    // tanks are skipped — no PlayerbotAI to run the driving AI), and the winner
    // is chosen by group kind:
    //   * Party (5-man): the lowest-GUID candidate — a deterministic, state-free
    //     pick every member computes identically.
    //   * Raid: the candidate flagged Main Tank (MEMBER_FLAG_MAINTANK) wins
    //     outright; with no MT flagged (or the flagged member not an eligible tank
    //     bot), the candidate with the highest equipped gear score wins,
    //     GUID-tiebroken — the most survivable tank to hold raid-wide threat.
    // Either way every member computes the same result (GetFirstMember walks the
    // whole raid, not just a sub-group), so they all agree on whom to follow.
