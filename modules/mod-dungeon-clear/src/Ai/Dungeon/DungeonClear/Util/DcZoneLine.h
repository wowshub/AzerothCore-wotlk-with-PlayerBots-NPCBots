// The instance ZONE LINE: the map-changing areatrigger volume at a dungeon's
// entrance (and the fall-catcher slabs around its rim), i.e. the one place in a
// dungeon where standing on the wrong yard of floor REMOVES a party member from
// the run.
//
// Why the pull planner has to know about it. An advanced pull drags the pack
// BACK onto already-cleared ground, and at the very first pull of a dungeon the
// only cleared ground behind the tank is the entrance it walked in through — so
// ComputeSafeCamp/ComputeTrailCamp happily plant the camp on, or beyond, the
// exit trigger. Nothing downstream catches it: the navmesh is blind to
// areatriggers, so IsNavReachable says yes, and the party is ordered to walk
// through the zone line to reach camp.
//
// What that costs depends on who is in the party. A pure bot party gets away
// with it — a headless bot sends no CMSG_AREATRIGGER, so the transfer never
// fires (the same asymmetry DcTestAreaTriggers::Arm exists to work around). A
// SELF-BOT is a real client: it reports the trigger, the server teleports it out
// of the instance, and the player is dumped outside mid-run. Hence the fix is a
// placement gate, not a movement one — a camp is never worth the risk, and the
// fallback (camp where the tank stands) is what a human tank does at a door
// anyway.
//
// Pure geometry, no map/nav/game state beyond the ObjectMgr stores, so both
// predicates are safe from any thread and cheap enough to sit beside
// CampBlockedByDoor / CampInHazard on every candidate.
namespace DcZoneLine
{
    // How much clear floor to demand between a camp anchor and the trigger
    // volume. A camp is not a point: bots fan out 1-2yd on their GUID-derived
    // camp slot, healers slide for LOS, and an AoE step-out moves a follower up
    // to ~8yd off the anchor. Every one of those yards has to still be inside
    // the instance, so the anchor buys the whole step-out width.

    // Slop for a WALK across the volume. Much thinner than CampMargin on
    // purpose: passing near a zone line is harmless (only entering it teleports),
    // so this only absorbs the difference between the straight segment we test
    // and the navmesh path the bot actually walks. A camp-sized margin here
    // would veto every candidate whose approach merely skirts the entrance.

    // orientation-rotated box — with ONE deliberate difference: `margin` pads
    // the volume in XY only, never in Z.
    //
    // That asymmetry is load-bearing. A dungeon's fall-catcher triggers are
    // wall-like slabs whose TOP surface sits just under the walkable floor
    // (Shadowfang's "South Fall Target" tops out 2.6yd below the courtyard it
    // runs beside). Padding their height would swallow the floor above them and
    // veto camps across a third of the keep; padding XY only leaves them exactly
    // as thin as they really are while still keeping the party a respectful
    // distance from the edge they hang off.
