    // went out. That is exactly Culling of Stratholme's Arthas at the Town Hall:

    // the drill-down bailed, his gossip flag survived, and the escort driver
    // re-clicked option 1 of the same menu ~4x/second for the rest of the run —
    // 2305 clicks in tr-20260910-083416-9, 10/10 runs of tp-20260910-083410-1.
    //
    // So compare the OPTION's action as well as the menu id: a scripted submenu
    // keeps the id and changes the action (DEF+2 -> DEF+3), a DB submenu changes
    // the id, and a menu that re-sends itself unchanged matches on both and stops
    // the loop. Sender-GUID emptiness is checked first because CloseGossipMenuFor

    // Its anchor->click step is 7.01yd against arriveRadius 6, and the log carries
    //   objective 'Altar of the Drakkari Colossus': dist=7.0 > arriveRadius=6.0
    //       (NOT arrived; event not started)
    // in the same second as the executor driving that event's step 0. The tank sits
    // ~7yd from its anchor making no net progress: posStuck and the stuck ladder
    // churn, the party drops into rest cycles, and DC yields those ticks — so the
    // tank spends long stretches not being driven by this module at all. In run 5 it
    // then travelled 115yd away under stock playerbots control and walked back, at
    // running speed and on the mesh the whole way (the monotonic off-route trace
    // 13.7 -> 114.6yd over 16s is a RUN, not a fall — bots do not walk into holes),
    // only to re-enter the deadlock. The run burns its entire budget this way.
    //
    // Retuning the radii is not the fix here: arriveRadius is ALSO the ring the
    // followers gather in, so it is capped by the anchor's measured walkable pad
    // (8.50 at this altar) and floored by the MoveTo's reach (8.26) — a 0.24yd
    // window whose only solutions park the party within centimetres of the drop.
    // ...AND THE SAME EXEMPTION FOR A LEADING Custom STEP ON A stepsOwnMovement
    // EVENT, for the same reason one step further out. A MoveTo walks the tank out
    // of its own arriveRadius by declaring a destination; a driver hook does it by
    // *being* the movement — DungeonEvent::stepsOwnMovement is precisely the
    // author's statement that this event's steps, not the per-tick
    // StopBot(Hold), own where the tank stands (see DcObjectiveArriveAction, which
    // reads the same flag to skip that hold). Such a hook is under exactly the
    // deadlock described above whenever its walk leaves the radius.

    // stalled and a 7th (tr-…-12) only won on a retry. That event is ONE bare
    // Custom step, so `stepIndex >= 1` is unreachable for its whole life — the
    // index reaches 1 only on the tick the hook returns Done, which is the tick the
    // event completes. The hook gathers on an anchor deliberately placed 73yd from
    // areatrigger 5633's centre (22yd OUTSIDE its sphere, so that ARRIVING cannot
    // trip it) and then walks the leader the 34.4yd in — against an arriveRadius of
    // 6.0. Six yards along that walk the at-objective trigger goes false, the hook
    // stops being ticked, Advance hauls the tank back to the anchor, repeat; the
    // successful run's status timeline is three of those cycles
    // ("Holding near Tyrannus's ledge" -> "En route to Tyrannus's ledge" x3) before

    // "started" cannot pin the run on a half-started event, which is the failure
