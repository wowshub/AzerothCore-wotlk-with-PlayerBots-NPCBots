/*
 * mod-dungeon-clear — DcPlayerbotCompat.h
 *
 * "Who is driving this character?", asked so that it means the same thing on
 * every mod-playerbots branch this module is built against.
 *
 * mod-playerbots PR #2592 (on test-staging; not on master as of Aug 2026)
 * reshuffled these predicates AND reused one of the names for something with
 * the opposite meaning:
 *
 *   before #2592                       after #2592
 *   ------------------------------     --------------------------------------
 *   botAI->IsRealPlayer()              IsSelfBot(player)
 *     master == bot, i.e. a SELF-BOT     same meaning, new name
 *   (no equivalent)                    IsRealPlayer(player)
 *                                        no PlayerbotAI at all — a person on
 *                                        a game client. The OPPOSITE of what
 *                                        the old member of that name tested.
 *   botAI->HasRealPlayerMaster()       botAI->HasGameClientMaster()
 *   botAI->HasActivePlayerMaster()     IsRealPlayer(botAI->GetMaster())
 *
 * So a module that must build on both cannot call either name directly: the
 * member is gone on one branch, and on the other the surviving free function
 * of the same name compiles fine and inverts the answer. That is not a
 * hypothetical — it is what makes this a shim rather than a typedef.
 *
 * Nothing here is conditional. Both predicates are written in terms of the two
 * pieces of API that are byte-identical on both branches — the
 * GET_PLAYERBOT_AI macro and the public PlayerbotAI::GetMaster() — and each is
 * literally the body of its branch's own version:
 *
 *   pre-#2592   IsRealPlayer()  { return master ? (master == bot) : false; }
 *   post-#2592  IsSelfBot(p)    { ai = GET_PLAYERBOT_AI(p); return ai && ai->GetMaster() == p; }
 *
 * which are the same test. No SFINAE, no version macro, no #if: there is
 * nothing to detect, so detecting it would only add a way to be wrong.
 *
 * Call these qualified (DcPlayerbotCompat::IsSelfBot(p)). Unqualified would be
 * ambiguous against the global IsSelfBot/IsRealPlayer that exist post-#2592.
 *
 * There is deliberately no HasGameClientMaster() here: DC does not need one,
 * and it is spelled IsHumanControlled(botAI->GetMaster()) if it ever does.
