// LongRangePathfinder computes the WHOLE smoothed route to a target in one
// shot, bypassing the engine PathGenerator's 74-poly / 74-point caps that
// forced StridedPathfinder to chunk long routes into ~180yd strides.
//
// It runs Detour directly against the map's navmesh using its OWN
// dtNavMeshQuery initialised with a large search-node pool (the shared
// engine query is only 1024 nodes — far too small for a dungeon-length A*,
// and we must not perturb it since every creature's movement uses it). The
// poly corridor and smoothed point buffers are sized for an entire dungeon,
// so total distance no longer matters: the result is a single PathSegment
// whose polyline is the full smoothed corridor, which DungeonPathFollower
// already walks point-by-point.
//
// This is the PRIMARY producer behind StridedPathfinder::Build. When it can
// build a reachable route the caller returns it directly; when it can't
// (no navmesh, target off-mesh, immediate static obstruction) the caller
// falls through to the hardened bee-line / arc / spawn-graph stride tiers.
//
// SPLIT FOR ASYNC OFFLOAD (review point #1). The expensive, navmesh-only A* +
// smoothing is BuildCoreFromMesh(): it takes a dtNavMesh* and plain floats and
// touches NO live game state (no Player*, no Map*, no VMAP), so it is safe to
// run on a background worker thread. The cheap, VMAP/live-state post-processing
// (per-point Z-snap, corridor centering, line-of-sight screen, segment
// assembly) is Finalize(): it must run on the owning map thread. Build()
// composes the two for the synchronous path (config toggle OFF).
