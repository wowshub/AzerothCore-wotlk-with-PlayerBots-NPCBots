// --- Karazhan (map 532) ----------------------------------------------------
//
// Plan: deployment-files/docs/mod-dungeon-clear_karazhan_plan.md.
//
// mod-playerbots ships a `karazhan` raid strategy that owns the fights (Attumen's
// phases, Moroes' adds, the Opera plays, Aran, Netherspite's beams, Nightbane's
// flight). This file owns only what happens OUT of combat: the roster, and the
// events that start the Opera and summon Nightbane.
//
// The auto-derived roster has ten anchors, built from instance_encounters credit
// spawns. The patch corrects four things:
//
//   * ATTUMEN IS MISSING. His credit entry is the mounted Attumen (16152), which
//     is summoned mid-fight and has no spawn row. The encounter is engaged
//     through Midnight (16151): neutral and REACT_DEFENSIVE, so nothing pulls him
//     but an attack. EngageDirect force-engages a non-hostile boss, so no special
//     case is needed. Midnight never dies on his own — he sits at a 1-HP floor,
//     goes invisible when the two merge, and is killed by the mounted Attumen's
//     JustDied, which is also what sets bit 0. MakeBossWithBit is the escape hatch
//     for exactly this: a real DBC bit whose derivation failed.
//
//     Midnight's evade boundary is a 50yd circle around his spawn (z 49-55), and
//     he despawns 10s after an evade. Boss anchors are engaged where the boss
//     stands (only BossPullbackRegistry drags one, and it has no row here), so
//     the fight stays in the stables.
//
//   * CHESS's credit spawn is the Status Bar (22520), a NOT_SELECTABLE trigger
//     that never dies — the script never sets a boss state or a kill bit for the
//     game at all. It is removed; the chess objective re-adds the encounter and
//     completes on GetData(DATA_CHESS_EVENT) == DONE (doneInstanceData), read
//     live because the win is not saved. See Chess() below and
//     Overrides/KarazhanChessDriver.cpp.
//
//   * PRINCE follows Chess, and only Chess: its DONE handler is the only thing
//     that opens the Gamesman's Hall Exit Door (184277), his only way in, and the
//     win is not saved. The clear orders Chess ahead of him, and the chess
//     objective reads DONE live, so after an instance reload the clear plays
//     chess again before it walks to Prince. A Chess skipped by hand leaves the
//     exit door shut — the approach stalls on it, which is the honest outcome.
//     His fight is the playerbots `karazhan` strategy's (enfeeble, infernals);
//     Netherspace is a sealed room (SealedEncounterRegistry).
//
//   * OPERA's credit spawn is Barnes (16812), a friendly NPC whose gossip starts
//     the play. He is removed here; the Opera event re-adds the encounter as an
//     objective.
//
//   * NIGHTBANE's spawn is a perch at (-11003.7, -1760.2, 140.3), on a mesh
//     island with no connection to the inside, and NON_ATTACKABLE. He is removed
//     and re-added on the Master's Terrace behind the Blackened Urn event.
//
// Order: Attumen, Moroes, Maiden, Opera, Nightbane, Curator, Terestian, Aran,
// Netherspite, Chess. Nightbane's slot was measured on the navmesh: fitting the urn in
// after Opera costs 249yd of extra walking, the next best slot 693yd.

namespace
{
    // The Opera. Barnes (friendly) offers his gossip only once Moroes is DONE and
    // the Opera is not: menu 7421 option 0, then the C++ submenu 7422 option 0,
    // which calls StartEvent — the slot goes IN_PROGRESS and he walks his escort
    // path (script_waypoint 16812): waypoint 0 opens Stage Door Left, waypoint 4
    // is ~45s of speech on the stage, waypoint 8 shuts Stage Door Left again
    // (not for Hood), and waypoint 9 opens the curtain and summons the cast,
    // NON_ATTACKABLE, on the line y -1758.
    //
    // Which play runs is rolled per instance, so the cast tells us: Dorothee for
    // Oz, Grandmother for Red Riding Hood, Julianne for Romulo and Julianne. Oz
    // and R&J release their cast into zone combat on timers. Hood waits for a
    // player to talk to Grandmother (7441 -> 7442 -> 7443, option 0 each); the
    // last select summons the Big Bad Wolf, which attacks the one who talked —
    // the tank, as it should be.
    //
    // A cast member evading sets FAIL, reopens Stage Door Left and respawns
    // Barnes for another go. DONE opens both stage doors. So the event owns the
    // whole encounter, retry included, and its objective completes on the slot
    // reading DONE (doneBossStateIndex):
    //
    //   0. raid muster at Barnes: everyone topped off and on the tank. Nobody
    //      may stop to drink backstage once he walks, or waypoint 8 locks them
    //      out of the fight;
    //   1. talk to Barnes;
    //   2. walk onto the stage with him and hold until the cast appears;
    //   3. Hood only: talk to Grandmother (skipped when she is not there);
    //   4. hold on the stage until DONE. The plays are combat, which the
    //      playerbots `karazhan` strategy owns (Oz priority, the Wolf kite, the
    //      R&J skull marks). FAIL rewinds to step 0.
