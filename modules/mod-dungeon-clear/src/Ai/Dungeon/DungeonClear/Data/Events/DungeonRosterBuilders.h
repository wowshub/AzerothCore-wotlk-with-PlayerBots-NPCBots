//
// Each Data/Events/<Dungeon>Events.cpp owns its roster patch as a
// Register<Dungeon>Roster appender (declared in DungeonEventTables.h) — the
// same one-file-per-dungeon "definition unit" the event rows already use. These
// helpers used to live in an anonymous namespace inside BossRosterRegistry.cpp;
// exposing them here (as inline free functions in namespace DcRoster) lets the
// patch data move next to the matching event rows while the central
// BossRosterRegistry keeps its Apply/HasPatch API and just aggregates the
// appenders. Open the namespace with `using namespace DcRoster;` at the top of
// each Register<Dungeon>Roster body.

    // instance_encounters credit is ENCOUNTER_CREDIT_KILL_CREATURE, because a
    // cast-spell credit carries a SPELL id where the creature entry would be and
    // there is no spawn to look coordinates up by. That filter is correct and
    // stays; this is the escape hatch for the bosses it hides.

    // Completion still rides GetCompletedEncounterMask exactly like every other
    // boss on the map: ObjectMgr stamps SPELL_ATTR0_CU_ENCOUNTER_REWARD on the
    // credit spell, Spell::finish calls Map::UpdateEncounterState, and the mask's
    // `1 << encounterIndex` bit is set — the same bit this parameter names. So
    // this is NOT the doneBossStateIndex case (a boss with no DBC row at all,
    // whose completion has to be read off the instance script's own slot); use
    // this whenever a real DungeonEncounter bit exists and only the DERIVATION
    // failed.

    // Drak'Tharon Keep's The Prophet Tharon'ja (26632, bit 3, credit spell 61863)

    // Champion's four (650) are the same shape and are the reason this is a named
    // builder rather than an inline struct fill.
    //
    // HALLS OF STONE (599) IS THE EXCEPTION, and it is worth naming because an
    // earlier draft of this comment listed it as an intended user. Its bit-2
    // encounter, the Tribunal of Ages (credit spell 59046), is hidden by the same
    // credit-type filter — but unlike Mal'ganis and the Grand Champions it has NO
    // CREATURE AT ALL. Brann Bronzebeard is friendly and is the escort, not the
    // encounter; the three stone faces (30898/30897/30899) are NOT_SELECTABLE
    // faction-114 NullCreatureAI spell emitters that cannot be targeted, damaged
    // or interrupted; and the encounter itself is a fixed 300-second survival
    // timer with no kill in it anywhere. This builder needs an `entry` to anchor
    // and to target, and there is nothing to put there. So map 599 authors the
    // Tribunal as MakeObjective(OBJ(2), ...) whose EVENT owns completion — the
    // shape the Violet Hold uses for its prisoner encounters — and the roster
    // patch in Data/Events/HallsOfStoneEvents.cpp says so at the call site.
