// Internal registration seam for the per-dungeon event tables.
//
// Each dungeon owns one .cpp in this folder that defines its event rows
// (Register<Dungeon>Events). A Conditional event's activation predicate is a
// free function defined in the SAME file, handed to the builder by pointer
// (.Conditional(&MyPredicate)) — there is no separate condition registry and no
// global id space to keep collision-free. The central DungeonEventRegistry calls
// the Register<Dungeon>Events aggregators EXPLICITLY so every per-dungeon
// translation unit stays referenced.
//
// Why explicit calls and not self-registering static initializers: the module
// compiles into a static lib, and a TU whose only output is constructor
// side-effects (with no symbol the program references) is dropped by the linker
// — its events would silently vanish. The one-big-table this replaces avoided
// that by keeping everything in a single referenced TU; the aggregator calls
// below restore the reference chain per file. (Same reason ObjectiveHookRegistry
// and friends use hardcoded tables.)
//
// Adding a dungeon:
//   1. Create <Dungeon>Events.cpp here.
//   2. Define Register<Dungeon>Events; for any Conditional event, define its
//      predicate as a static free function in that file and pass &Predicate to
//      .Conditional() (a typo is a compile error, not a silent never-fire).
//   3. Declare the appender below.
//   4. Add the call in EventTable() (DungeonEventRegistry.cpp).
//   5. If the dungeon corrects the auto-derived boss list, define its roster
//      patch as Register<Dungeon>Roster in the SAME file (using the DcRoster
//      builders in DungeonRosterBuilders.h), declare it below, and add the call
//      in PatchTable() (BossRosterRegistry.cpp). One file owns all of a
//      dungeon's clear data: event rows + conditions + roster patch.

// Shared, cross-dungeon activation predicate — external linkage so several
// dungeon files can pass &DcRoomAggroPreClearCondition to .Conditional().
// DUE while the room-trash value still has anything to clear (every
// RoomAggroRegistry boss: SM Cathedral, Scholomance Marduk & Vectus, ...).

// box, its route slice and the point it ends at need exactly ONE definition, and
// the probe suite re-derives them against the real mesh.
//
// NO ROSTER PATCH, and that is worth writing down rather than leaving as an
// absence. All four of map 602's instance_encounters rows are creditType 0
// (ENCOUNTER_CREDIT_KILL_CREATURE) against real `creature` spawns, and
// DungeonEncounter.dbc's order (Bjarngrim 0, Volkhan 1000, Ionar 2000, Loken
// 3000) IS the walking order — so BossSpawnIndex::Build derives the whole list
// with correct coordinates on both difficulties. This is the first WotLK map in
// the module where that is true; the previous four (Halls of Stone, Drak'Tharon,
// Gundrak, The Nexus) each needed a patch to be runnable at all. Do not add one
// here: the transit below is a CONDITIONAL event, which needs no roster row, no
// order keys and no OBJ() anchor, and a patch could only make things worse.
//
// DIFFICULTY TWINS ARE STAT TEMPLATES, NOT ENTRIES. Almost every creature on
// this map has one (Slag 28585 -> 30970, Volkhan 28587 -> 31536, ...), and
// Creature::InitEntry resolves DifficultyEntry[diff-1] into m_creatureInfo and
// then does SetEntry(Entry) — "normal entry always" — so GetEntry() returns the
// NORMAL id on heroic. Every entry-keyed constant below is the normal id and is
// correct on both difficulties. Do not add the 30xxx/31xxx ids anywhere.
//
// EVERY COORDINATE HERE IS COLUMN-PROBED against the live 602 mmtiles
// (t/TestHallsOfLightningRouteProbe), and on this map that is not ceremony. The
// mmtiles carry flat sheets far below the dungeon — a continuous surface at
// z ~ -1.9 and another at z ~ -13.9 under essentially the whole footprint — so
// map 602 is in the flat-grid-height family ([[ac-map601-flat-gridheight-zero]])
// and an anchor authored from a script literal rather than from the probed TOP
// surface is a sink waiting to happen. The open centre of Bjarngrim's ring
// (1330, 30) has NO dungeon floor at all: probing it returns 143.02, -1.88,
// -13.88, so a hold point or camp placed there drops a bot 45-55yd.

    //      every poly below z 40 removed returns NO PATH from Bjarngrim's floor
    //      to Volkhan. The party must descend 17yd from the hall's south arm
    //      (z 40.7 -> z 23.9), walk ~110yd south along the pit floor, climb the
    //      far wall to the mid ledge (z 38.6) and climb again to the gallery
    //      (z 52.7) — 395yd of route for 80yd of straight line. There is no
    //      upper gallery route.
    //   2. FOURTEEN SLAG (28585) LINE THE WALKWAY ON A TWENTY-SECOND RESPAWN
    //      (`creature.spawntimesecs = 20`, MovementType 1, wander_distance 8 —
    //      the shortest respawn on any map this module runs). Twelve of the
    //      fourteen are within 20yd of the route line in 2D; with the wander all
    //      fourteen reach it, and level 79 against level 80 is inside base aggro
    //      range for the whole walk.
    //   3. SO THE CLEAR HAS NO DRIVER IN THERE. DcCombatFlag::MayDrive is false
    //      while anything in the party is engaged and Advance is registered only
    //      in the NON-combat engine, so party engagement never drops for the
    //      no-engage grace window. The leg is not slow; it is stopped. This is
    //      Blackwing Lair's Suppression Rooms one tier down.

    // AND KILLING THEM IS NEGATIVE PROGRESS, which is why the answer is a
    // transit and not a clear. Each Slag is 15 828 HP with DamageModifier 1 —
    // trivial, harmless in melee — but smart_scripts 28585 id 1/3 is
    // `On Just Died -> Blast Wave` (23113 normal / 22424 heroic): 10yd, and

// DcHallsOfLightning and DcVioletHold are: several are SAFETY numbers whose
// whole value is that a test can re-derive them from live data, and a literal
// buried in a .cpp cannot be pinned.
//
// EVERY COORDINATE BELOW IS ROUTED OR COLUMN-PROBED against the live map-575
// mmtiles (t/TestUtgardePinnacleRouteProbe). Map 575 is NOT in the
// flat-grid-height family ([[ac-map601-flat-gridheight-zero]]) — every fixed
// point snaps with d2d 0.00 and dz between +0.0 and +0.5, and the only larger
// deltas are the two portcullis ORIGINS (+3.92, +1.83), which is ordinary: a
// door origin sits below its own threshold.
//
// THE ONE THING TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT THIS DUNGEON. It does not have a door
// problem; it has a ONE-ROW ROSTER problem, and the door stall is the
// second-order symptom. instance_encounters credits Svala at entry 26668, which
// has NO SPAWN ROW ANYWHERE IN THE DB — boss_svala.cpp does
// me->UpdateEntry(NPC_SVALA_SORROWGRAVE) ~34s into the intro cinematic, so the
// entry only exists at runtime. BossSpawnIndex::Build joins creditEntry ->
// creature spawn row, matches nothing, and drops the first boss SILENTLY. The
// derived roster is 3 bosses for a 4-boss dungeon.
//
// That single missing row is what walked tr-20260902-083808-1 into two shut
// portcullises: with Svala gone the clear's first target is Palehoof, and the
// navmesh — baked DOOR-BLIND — offers a 696yd shortcut to him that threads BOTH
// gates. The designed first leg to Svala is 362 + 101yd and threads NEITHER.
// See [[dc-credit-entry-is-an-updateentry-target]] and the roster patch in
// UtgardePinnacleEvents.cpp.
//
// DIFFICULTY TWINS ARE STAT TEMPLATES, NOT ENTRIES, exactly as on map 602:
// Creature::InitEntry resolves DifficultyEntry[diff-1] into m_creatureInfo and
// then SetEntry(Entry), so GetEntry() returns the NORMAL id on heroic. Every
// entry-keyed constant here is the normal id and is correct on both
// difficulties. Do not add the 307xx/308xx heroic clones anywhere.
//
// AND SVALA IS DBC BIT 0 ON BOTH DIFFICULTIES (rows 577/578), unlike Gundrak
// and the Nexus — so ONE Any-gated roster patch serves normal and heroic, and
// the DBC order (Svala 0, Palehoof 1000, Skadi 2000, Ymiron 3000) IS the travel

    // Opcode, which re-tests Player::IsInAreaTriggerRadius(atEntry, 0.f). For a

    // to be physically inside the box.

    // WHICH MAKES THE ARRIVE RADIUS A CONTAINMENT RADIUS, not a tolerance. Both
    // the objective's arrival trigger (DungeonClearTriggers.cpp) and the event's
    // leading MoveTo step (DungeonEventExecutor::RunStep) latch on
    // GetExactDist(anchor) <= arriveRadius and then STOP the tank. An arrive

    // the raid somewhere else.
    //
    // It exists because of what the ordinary pipeline does the moment Grethok's
    // anchor clears: the next boss becomes Razorgore, and Razorgore — possessed,
    // being driven egg to egg by our own runner — is a MOVING anchor. The advance
    // then does exactly what it does for any wandering boss: it re-paths at his
    // live position every few seconds and holds at the engage range, and the
    // followers, who follow the tank, come with it. Measured on the first live
    // run of the egg phase (23:14:41 and 23:15:47, 45yd and 42yd splines issued
    // at the possessed boss, interleaved with "within engage range of Razorgore
    // the Untamed (25yd/27yd/11yd/23yd/17yd) -> holding for at-boss"): the raid

    // (DungeonClearRazorgoreCampTrigger), which holds inside the leash and walks
    // a drifted bot back to its near edge.

// THE MOST SCRIPT-DRIVEN 5-MAN IN WOTLK, and the first map in this module where
// DC's pull/advance pipeline is the WRONG TOOL for most of the dungeon rather
// than merely a tool that needs help.
//
// Three properties shape everything below.
//
//   1. NOTHING IS PULLABLE. Falric, Marwyn and all 34 wave mobs are PRE-SPAWNED
//      invisible, UNIT_FLAG_NOT_SELECTABLE and SetImmuneToAll. The instance
//      activates them one wave at a time and THEY attack — on the FARTHEST
//      player. There is no trash to clear and no boss to pull between the first
//      gossip and Marwyn's death, so a conditional driver owns the party for
//      that whole stretch (event 2) and the derived Falric/Marwyn anchors are
//      outranked while it does. tr-20260907-100815-2 is what happens without
//      it: the tank routed past Jaina to Marwyn's invisible, immune spawn and
//      stood on him for five minutes.
//
//   2. THE MAP HAS A HARD LEASH WITH A SILENT, EXPENSIVE FAILURE MODE. While a
//      wave is live, ANY non-GM player more than MAX_DIST_FROM_CENTER_IN_COMBAT
//      (70.5yd, 2D) from CenterPos wipes the event and replays waves 1-4 with
//      every dead mob respawned. The front door is 65yd from centre and the
//      entrance is 103. A bot that RELEASES during waves is locked out
//      (Map::CannotEnter special-cases 668 through IsEncounterInProgress) until
//      the survivors wipe or kill Marwyn.
//
//   3. THE LICH KING (36954) IS A PLAIN HOSTILE CREATURE WITH unit_flags 0. No
//      immunity flag protects him, he force-flags every player into combat every
//      second, and stock playerbots' assist triggers WILL attack him. He heals
//      himself to 75% below 70%, so the damage is pure waste — but the real cost
//      is movement: one bot holding him as a victim makes DcCombatFlag::IsEngaged
//      true for the party and freezes every MayDrive rung with a Lich King
//      walking 1.4yd/s behind. See NPC_LICH_KING and the three registry rows
//      that keep the party off him (DcTargetExclusionRegistry with alsoTank,
//      DcNeverTargetRegistry, and the widened hold-fire rung).

// and not bosses: ALL FOUR of this dungeon's encounters are script TempSummons
// with NO `creature` spawn row anywhere on the map, so BossSpawnIndex's
// instance_encounters -> spawn join emits nothing at all.
//
// The DBC data itself is complete and correct — DungeonEncounter rows 293-296
// (normal) / 297-300 (heroic) give bits 0 Meathook, 1 Salramm, 2 Epoch,
// 3 Mal'ganis, and Mal'ganis's cast-spell credit (58630) exists as a spell_dbc
// row so ObjectMgr really does stamp it SPELL_ATTR0_CU_ENCOUNTER_REWARD. So
// 0xF IS the expected final encounterMask on a fully cleared run even though
// the roster carries no boss rows: the bits are flipped by the kills the
// objectives' events perform.
//
// THE WHOLE DUNGEON IS ONE MONOTONIC COUNTER. GetData(DATA_ARTHAS_EVENT) climbs
// 0 -> 11 and never regresses (an Arthas death repositions him to the current
// value's checkpoint and re-arms his gossip; it does not roll the counter back),
// which is what makes every gate here a >= test — the safe shape, because the
// event engine is dormant in combat and a transient "boss is up" window can be
// missed outright.
//

// counter, five item uses, or a kill. Nothing in this instance keys on player
// position and there is not one areatrigger on the critical path — so, unlike

// 68663), every boss is a script summon with no `creature` row, and two of the
// three NEVER DIE — the Grand Champions and Eadric/Paletress park at 1 HP, turn
// friendly and evade. So BossSpawnIndex emits nothing and every run used to fail
// at setup with "no boss roster for this map", the Culling of Stratholme
// diagnosis exactly.
//
// THE WHOLE DUNGEON IS ONE COUNTER, GetData(DATA_INSTANCE_PROGRESS), 0..9, and
// the announcer's gossip, which he re-offers at 0, 6 and 8. Unlike the Culling's
// counter this one GOES BACKWARDS: a full wipe runs InstanceCleanup, which
// rewinds 1-4 to 0 and 7 to 6 and re-homes the announcer with his gossip up. So
// nothing here may latch on having clicked him — the driver re-decides from the
// counter every tick, and the three objectives hold on thresholds a rewind
// cannot satisfy early.
//
// PHASE 1 IS A JOUST AND IT IS WON BY TRAMPLING, NOT BY DAMAGE. A Grand Champion
// at 1 HP drops his mount, goes NON_ATTACKABLE and walks to a spare horse, and
// remounts at 50k HP; 4 -> 5 needs all three dismounted at once, and a player
// riding the party's OWN-faction horse within 5yd of a walking champion stuns
// him for 15s. The fighting — lance, mount, the four vehicle buttons, the Charge
// cycle and the trample shadowing — is mod-playerbots' `wotlk-toc` strategy.

// Eregos — is the rider rung (Action/DcOculusRiderAction.cpp), because every
// member steers its OWN drake. The decisions are pure kernels:
// Util/DcOculusDriverDecision.h and Util/DcOculusFlightDecision.h.

// THREE CORE TRAPS DECIDE THE DESIGN (oculus.cpp):
//   * a drake bar spell that hits a hostile whose CanFly() is false KILLS THE

//     anyone is in combat, and nobody hovers over a ground fight;
//   * a drake despawns 2s after its rider leaves and 5s after summon if nobody
//     boards — every landing costs a fresh essence use (15s cooldown);
//   * Vehicle::RemovePassenger casts no parachute inside an instance, and a
//     clientless bot never falls — a mid-air dismount strands it. The rider only

// Blackwing Lair (469) — Vaelastrasz -> Broodlord Lashlayer, the suppression
// rooms. Unlike the Azjol-Nerub row this is NOT there because the mesh defeats
// the pathfinder: the corridor routes fine. It is there because the SUPPRESSION
// TRANSIT needs a fixed, monotone polyline to run a cursor along — the pack
// leash, the hold decisions and the telemetry all measure against the same
// authored legs, and a route re-derived every tick from the leader's live
// position is not something a cursor can advance through. See

// as the Blackwing Lair row and not the Azjol-Nerub one: the corridor routes
// fine, but the SLAG FURNACE TRANSIT needs a fixed, monotone polyline to run a
// cursor along, and the middle of that row is sliced out and handed to the driver
// (DcHallsOfLightning::TRANSIT_STAGE_ANCHOR_INDEX .. TRANSIT_END_ANCHOR_INDEX).

// Utgarde Pinnacle (575) — SIX rows, one per designed leg, and the Azjol-Nerub
// reason rather than the Blackwing Lair / Halls of Lightning one: nothing here
// runs a transit cursor, but the navmesh is baked DOOR-BLIND and the A* corridors
// it offers between these anchors thread two permanently shut portcullises. The
// 206yd entrance -> Ymiron shortcut is the sharpest case — the SHORTEST path in
// the dungeon and impassable for the whole run. The anchor route is what stops
// A* re-deriving it on every rebuild.
//
// Each row is keyed on the entry of the leg's DESTINATION (boss or objective) and
// STARTS AT THE PREVIOUS ONE, because SeedCursor projects the party onto the row
// from where it stands and a row that starts somewhere else snaps the cursor to
// the far end ([[dc-anchor-route-must-cover-where-the-party-stands]]).

// Pit of Saron (658) — TWO rows, Krick -> the ledge and the ledge -> Tyrannus.
//
// The long row exists for BOTH of the reasons the other maps' rows exist, one
// after the other along the same leg. Over the gauntlet it is the Blackwing Lair
// / Halls of Lightning reason — a fixed polyline for the ordinary clear to walk
// while the driver owns the gates — and it carries AnchorFlag::NO_STOP across the
// three gate crossings and the icicle tunnel, because a camp dragged back down
// this corridor would put the party back inside a sphere it has already spent.
// Past the tunnel it is the plain "walk the leg" reason.
//
// Each row is keyed on the entry of its DESTINATION and STARTS WHERE THE PARTY
// WILL BE STANDING when that leg begins, because DungeonPathFollower::SeedCursor
// projects the bot onto the row from its own position and a row that starts
// somewhere else snaps the cursor to the far end
// ([[dc-anchor-route-must-cover-where-the-party-stands]]).

// King's anchor.
//
// The first two are the plain "walk the leg" reason plus one door apiece
// (197341 and 197342, both script-only). The escape row is the Blackwing Lair /
// Halls of Lightning reason taken to its limit: the driver moves the tank stand
// point to stand point with TravelTo and never consults the row at all, but if
// it EVER yields the leg to DcRel::Advance the party must move FORWARD along
// the path and must never plan a camp on it — so every anchor carries NO_STOP
// and the row runs strictly -x, -y from the throne room to WP18.

// Karazhan (532) — the entrance to Attumen (keyed on Midnight). The plain "walk
// the leg" reason with a twist: the corridor routes fine, but it runs along the

// what holds the engage until the party has come round to the pen's west mouth.
