// --- Blackrock Depths (map 230) — the RING OF LAW, ANCHORED + PERSISTENT ---
// A sealed arena gauntlet that gates the way between Houndmaster Grebmar and
// Pyromancer Loregrain. A party member steps onto the centre (area trigger
// 1526), the entrance gate slams shut, Grimstone (10096) summons two random
// trash waves then one random boss, and on the boss's death the forward gate
// opens. Nothing the party fights is in the spawn tables — the waves and boss
// are all SUMMONED and randomised — so the event is purely position/state based.
//
// Navigation is done by the boss list: the Ring of Law is added as an OBJECTIVE
// anchor at the arena centre (BossRosterRegistry, encounterIndex 3, between
// Grebmar at 2 and Loregrain at 4). Boss-nav drives the tank into the arena
// exactly as to any boss; the event then runs in place.
//
// The arena is COME-TO-YOU: every summon AttackStart()s a random player within
// 100yd, so the party never pulls — it holds the centre and the combat engine
// fights reactively as the waves and boss arrive. We therefore do NOT use
// ClearRadius (a "done when the band is empty" gate would false-complete during
// the ~12s Grimstone intro and the ~10s wave-2->boss gap, both of which leave
// the floor momentarily empty while the arena is still sealed). It would also
// risk driving an outward engage UP to the hostile spectator gallery (z ~ -35)
// or DOWN toward Grebmar's prison (z ~ -84), which flank the floor (z ~ -54).
//
// Instead the completion gate is the instance state reaching DONE
// (TYPE_RING_OF_LAW == DONE): it can't be missed across a combat tick-gap and
// can't fire during the empty-floor windows. The tank garrisons dead-centre,
// re-centring between fights (the MoveTo re-checks distance every tick), until
// the whole gauntlet is done — at which point the objective latches and the
// clear proceeds out the now-open north gate toward Loregrain.
//
// TYPE_RING_OF_LAW IS NOT MONOTONIC, unlike the phase counters the instance-data
// gate is usually pointed at. npc_grimstone runs its own watchdog (updateReset):
// once a wave or the boss is out and 30s pass with no summon holding a victim, it
// SetData(FAIL)s — which despawns Grimstone and every summon, puts the gates back
// as they were, and drops the state to NOT_STARTED. Nothing in the core restarts
// it, and nothing on our side used to either: the Custom step that fired the
// areatrigger had latched Done, and the test-run areatrigger relay is EDGE-
// triggered on a volume the party is standing in. The party then held an empty
// arena for the whole 600s timeout. That is what tr-20260808-150405-10 did.
// .WhileHolding re-runs the start hook from inside the garrison, so a reset is
// re-fired (the core's own 2-minute post-fail cooldown decides when it takes).
//
// PERSISTENT because a multi-combat arena event sees a >1s Drive gap after each
// wave/boss fight (the bot is on the combat engine); a non-persistent event
// would rewind to step 0 each time.
