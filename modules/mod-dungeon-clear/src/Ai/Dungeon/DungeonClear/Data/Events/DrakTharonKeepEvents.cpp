// --- Drak'Tharon Keep (map 600) -------------------------------------------
//
// One navmesh component, no break, no drop, no teleport leg, and the DBC's
// encounter order (0 Trollgore, 1 Novos, 2 King Dred, 3 The Prophet Tharon'ja)
// is already the shortest travel order — 422 + 206 + 354 + 643 = 1625yd by
// Dijkstra over the 23 map-600 mmtiles' poly graph. So nothing here is about
// routing. Three things are authored, in descending order of value:
//
//   1. THE FOURTH BOSS IS INVISIBLE TO THE CLEAR, and that is a data defect,
//      not a tuning one. See below — it ends every run at 3/4.
//   2. NOVOS THE SUMMONER is a camp-and-hold set-piece with a hard kill gate and
//      a 1665-damage-per-second pool on the boss for the whole of phase 1. It is
//      the only encounter on the map the stock engage pipeline cannot do
//      unaided.
//   3. KING DRED'S RAPTOR POOL (heroic only) is one free level-74 elite every
//      ~30s for the whole fight unless it is emptied first.
//
// --- 1. Tharon'ja is missing from the derived roster — ROOT CAUSE ----------
//
// instance_encounters, map 600 (both difficulties, verified live):
//
//     369/370  bit 0  Trollgore              creditType 0  creditEntry 26630
//     371/372  bit 1  Novos the Summoner     creditType 0  creditEntry 26631
//     373/374  bit 2  King Dred              creditType 0  creditEntry 27483
//     375/376  bit 3  The Prophet Tharon'ja  creditType 1  creditEntry 61863  <-- SPELL
//
// BossSpawnIndex::Build skips every encounter that is not
// ENCOUNTER_CREDIT_KILL_CREATURE, because a cast-spell credit's `creditEntry` is
// a SPELL id and there is no creature to look a spawn position up by. That
// filter is right and stays. The consequence is that Tharon'ja never enters
// `_store`, NextDungeonBossValue empties after King Dred, AllClearedTrigger
// fires and the run declares itself finished at 3/4.
//
// The fix is the roster patch below plus one new builder
// (DcRoster::MakeBossWithBit) that lets an added boss carry an EXPLICIT
// encounterIndex. `completionFrom` cannot express this: it resolves a kill-bit
// by looking the source entry up in the DERIVED list, and the whole problem is
// that Tharon'ja is not in it.
//
// Completion then works exactly as it does for the other three. His
// boss_tharon_jaAI::JustDied casts 61863; ObjectMgr stamps
// SPELL_ATTR0_CU_ENCOUNTER_REWARD on every cast-spell credit spell, Spell::finish
// calls Map::UpdateEncounterState(ENCOUNTER_CREDIT_CAST_SPELL, 61863, ...), and
// that sets bit 3 on the instance's completed-encounter mask — the same mask
// NextDungeonBossValue already reads for Trollgore, Novos and Dred.
//
// NOT USED HERE, deliberately: doneBossStateIndex. The instance script's index
// space is SHIFTED relative to the DBC on this map — DATA_TROLLGORE 0,
// DATA_NOVOS 1, DATA_NOVOS_CRYSTALS 2 (a door pseudo-encounter, not a boss),
// DATA_DRED 3, DATA_THARON_JA 4 — so Dred's DBC bit is 2 while his SetBossState
// slot is 3. Reading the DBC mask keeps all four bosses on ONE completion
// source; mixing the two is how a divergence hides (the Nexus Frozen Commander
// note makes the same argument from the other direction).
//
// THIS DEFECT IS NOT DTK-SPECIFIC. Every creditType-1 encounter is invisible the
// same way: CoT Stratholme (595, Mal'ganis, spell 58630), Halls of Stone (599,
// Tribunal of Ages, 59046) and Trial of the Champion (650, the Grand Champions /
// Argent Champion / Black Knight) are all in the clear's gear-tier list and all
// short a boss today. MakeBossWithBit is written to be reused for them; each is
// one patch of its own and is deliberately NOT bundled into this change.
//
// UPDATE — Halls of Stone is now done (Data/Events/HallsOfStoneEvents.cpp), and
// it did NOT use MakeBossWithBit. Its missing encounter has no creature to anchor
// or target at all, and on that map the missing bit was not merely a scoreboard
// gap: the Tribunal is the only thing that opens the door to the last boss, so
// the patch is three objectives and a wave driver rather than one roster row. See
// the note on MakeBossWithBit in DungeonRosterBuilders.h. 595 and 650 remain
// straightforward users of this builder — both hide REAL creature spawns.
//
// --- 2. Novos: the gate, the pool, and the decoy pile ----------------------
//
// boss_novos.cpp, verified against the live script:
//
//   * RESTING. Reset() sets UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_MOVE (he is rooted for the whole
//     encounter) and CLEARS NON_ATTACKABLE / NOT_SELECTABLE. MoveInLineOfSight is
//     overridden to do nothing, so HE NEVER AGGROS ON PROXIMITY — somebody has to
//     hit him. The ordinary at-boss engage does that; nothing here is needed for
//     the pull itself.
//   * PHASE 1 (JustEngagedWith). He re-sets NON_ATTACKABLE | NOT_SELECTABLE — so
//     for the whole of phase 1 no bot can target him at all — and casts
//     SPELL_ARCANE_FIELD 47346 on himself. From Spell.dbc that is
//     SPELL_EFFECT_PERSISTENT_AREA_AURA at TARGET_DEST_CASTER, EffectRadiusIndex
//     42 = 11.0yd, amplitude 1000ms, BasePoints+DieSides = 1665 damage per
//     second, plus a −50% movement-speed leg. A DynamicObject lands on his feet
//     and is the phase-1 keep-out; see the DcHazardRegistry row.
//   * THE GATE. A task scheduled at 70s tests `me->HasAura(SPELL_BEAM_CHANNEL)`
//     and REPEATS EVERY 2s FOREVER while it holds. Four Crystal Channel Targets
//     (26712, one under each Ritual Crystal) channel 52106 on him, and the only
//     thing that silences one is a CRYSTAL HANDLER (26627) DYING. Four handlers
//     spawn on me->m_Events at 16s / 32s / 48s / 64s, alternating right-room and
//     left-room, each SetInCombatWithZone() on summon — THEY COME TO YOU. So:
//     kill all four handlers; Novos becomes attackable ~70s after the pull or 2s
//     after the fourth handler dies, whichever is later. There is no timeout
//     escape and no other way through.
//   * THE ADD STREAM, all from the ROOM_STAIRS trigger 45yd up the staircase
//     south of the chamber at (-378.40, -813.13, 59.74):
//       Fetid Troll Corpse 27598 — first at 3s then EVERY 3s, REACT_DEFENSIVE,
//         MovePoint(1, -373.56, -770.86, 28.59) down to the stairs' foot, and
//         SummonMovementInform then DoZoneInCombat()s it. ~23 over phase 1, and
//         the only summon that actually engages.
//       Risen Shadowcaster 27600 (9s then 10s) and Hulking Corpse 27597 (30s then
//         30s) — REACT_DEFENSIVE and LEFT STANDING AT THE SPAWN POINT. They never
//         walk down and never aggro unless attacked: a pile of passive-but-
//         hostile mobs 45 yards up a staircase, which is the Mechanar bridge
//         gauntlet's failure mode with different scenery. A clear that goes
//         LOOKING for them walks the party out of the fight and off the leash.
//   * THE LEASH. CheckEvadeIfOutOfCombatArea() is
//     `!SelectTargetFromPlayerList(80.0f)`, so at least one player must stay
//     within 80yd of Novos or the encounter resets.
//
// WHY A CONDITIONAL EVENT WITH DrivesInCombat, NOT AN ANCHORED ONE. The party is
// in continuous combat from the pull — a Fetid Troll Corpse every three seconds —
// so there is no out-of-combat tick between the pull and the gate opening.
// Anchored events drive on the non-combat engine only, and the conditional rung
// stands down on bot->IsInCombat(); either would run in gaps that do not exist.
// This is the Black Morass wave-driver shape and it is the same lesson, from the
// Mechanar bridge onward: hold the camp, let them come.
//
// WHY THE CAMP IS WHERE IT IS — (-379.0, -757.0), column-probed against the live
// 600 mmtiles as one walkable surface at z 28.39:
//
//     19.3yd from Novos — outside the 11yd Arcane Field with 8yd of margin, and
//                         far inside the 80yd leash.
//     14.9yd from (-373.56, -770.86), the Fetid Troll Corpses' arrival point, so
//                         the stream walks straight into the camp.
//     56yd  from the stairs spawn trigger — far enough that a garrisoned party
//                         has no reason to climb to the decoy pile.
//
// --- 3. King Dred's raptor pool (heroic only) ------------------------------
//
// boss_dred.cpp schedules SPELL_RAPTOR_CALL 59416 `if (IsHeroic())` — first at
// 16s, then every 30s. Its spell script does
// GetCreatureListWithEntryInGrid({26628 Drakkari Scytheclaw, 26641 Drakkari
// Gutripper}, 100.0f) and AttackStart()s a random one that is alive and NOT
// already in combat, on Dred's current victim. Nine spawns qualify, seven of them
// inside the pen. Left unpulled that is a free level-74 elite every ~30s for the
// entire fight. On normal difficulty the spell is never cast, so there is no row.
//
// --- also authored elsewhere for this map ---------------------------------
//   * DcNeverTargetRegistry — Novos Summon Target (27583). THE softlock: it is a
//     fully selectable, attackable, faction-14 elite, and a dead one cannot cast
//     SPELL_SUMMON_CRYSTAL_HANDLER, so killing one permanently stops a Crystal
//     Handler spawning, which leaves a Beam Channel that is never silenced, which
//     means Novos never becomes attackable for the life of the instance.
//   * FightInPlaceRegistry — Trollgore's arena. boss_trollgore's CheckInRoom() is
//     `Y >= -700 && Y <= -628` and failing it calls EnterEvadeMode(BOUNDARY)
//     every tick, so any pull that drags him south toward the Novos corridor
//     evades the boss outright.
//   * DcEventDoorRegistry::IsNavigationIgnored — the four Ritual Crystals
//     (189299-189302), a 27x26yd square of DOOR_TYPE_ROOM gameobjects the party
//     walks through to reach Novos, on lock 1669 (a key item no bot has).
//   * DcHazardRegistry — Arcane Field 47346 (phase 1), Blizzard 49034 (phase 2)
//     and Tharon'ja's Poison Cloud 49548.
//
// --- deliberately NOT authored --------------------------------------------
//   * NO RoomAggroRegistry / ClearRadius row at Novos. The adds come to the
//     party; a pre-clear sweep would walk it up the staircase into the decoy
//     pile, which is the exact failure the camp exists to prevent.
//   * NO SealedEncounterRegistry row anywhere. Nothing closes behind the party.
//   * NO Trollgore event. The invader stream comes to him and the arena is small,
//     so the engage pipeline should handle it once the fight-in-place box stops
//     the pull dragging him out of his Y band. Revisit only if run data shows the
//     party chasing invaders toward the east balcony.
//   * NO route anchors. Unlike Azjol-Nerub the mesh here defeats nothing.
//   * NO handling for Tharon'ja's Gift (52509) — 26 seconds of MOD_CHARM +
//     OVERRIDE_ACTIONBAR_SPELLS on every player at 55% HP. Playerbots rotations
//     are not written against an overridden action bar, so expect ~26s per fight
//     of bots doing nothing useful. That is a rotation question, not a clear
//     question; it is a known cost, recorded here so it is not re-derived as a
//     dungeon-clear bug.

    // seconds and four handlers walk in on a 16s cadence.
    //
    // What a step list could not express here:
    //   * The gate is a KILL COUNT the party never chooses targets for. The

    //     camp; a KillCreature(26627, 4) gate would be correct and completely
    //     inert, because nothing has to be sought.
    //   * The failure modes are all POSITIONAL and all reversible mid-fight: the
    //     tank drifting north into the Arcane Field as it chases a corpse, or
    //     south/up the staircase toward the passive Shadowcaster pile. A step
    //     list can hold ONE position; it cannot decide, per tick, whether the
    //     tank is somewhere it is allowed to be.
    //   * MoveToHoldUntilSpawn / ...InstanceData / ...PersistentData all miss:
    //     instance_drak_tharon_keep overrides neither GetData nor
    //     SetPersistentData, and GetBossState(DATA_NOVOS_CRYSTALS) only flips to
    //     DONE on Novos' DEATH — long after the hold should have ended.
    //
    // DRIVES IN COMBAT — the load-bearing flag, and the Black Morass lesson
    // verbatim. A Fetid Troll Corpse spawns every 3s and DoZoneInCombat()s
    // itself, so the party is in combat continuously from the pull to the gate.
    // The conditional rung stands down on bot->IsInCombat(), so without this the
    // driver would never run once and the tank would simply fight wherever the
    // pull left it — inside an 1665-per-second pool.
    //
    // STEPS OWN MOVEMENT — the hook issues the garrison itself, so the per-tick
    // hold in DcRunEventAction must not cancel it before the hook has looked at
    // it (the Old Hillsbrad barrel trap). It also makes the driver YIELD the tick
    // whenever the hook reports Done, which is the only reason the tank still has
    // a rotation: this rung sits above the stock combat movers and an action that
    // returned true every tick would starve them outright.
    //
    // REPEATABLE — the hook reports Done every tick the tank is correctly camped
    // (that IS the yield), so a one-shot latch would end the hold on the first
    // in-position tick, ~1 second into a 70-second phase. The condition going
    // false is the real end.

    // gaps instead of being re-based by each one — which is why the budget below
    // is set at five minutes rather than the 30s default. Every ClearRadius event
    // in this folder carries the flag; keeping it means a later author who adds a
    // by-entry backstop step (the Ahn'kahet shape) does not have to remember to.
    //
    // NO BY-ENTRY BACKSTOP, unlike Ahn'kahet's initiate sweep, and for a reason
    // that does not generalise: a ClearRadius resolves candidates through
    // NearestHostileNearPoint, so anything IsPossibleTarget / IsEngageReachable
    // rejects is invisible to it and the step can answer "clear" with a raptor
    // alive. There it mattered (Jedoga never descends over a live initiate, so
    // the run walks to a permanently immune boss); here the entire consequence is
    // that Raptor Call has one more thing to call, which is the ordinary
