// --- Blackwing Lair (map 469) — Razorgore the Untamed, phase 1 -------------
//
// The declarative half of the encounter DC has to orchestrate inside somebody
// else's fight. One conditional event, one Custom step, and a predicate that
// decides when the driver owns the tick. The controller is
// Overrides/BlackwingLairDriver.cpp; the arithmetic is Util/DcRazorgoreDecision.h;
// the numbers both halves share are namespace DcBlackwingLair in
// DungeonEventTables.h.
//
// WHY THIS ONE IS DIFFERENT FROM EVERY OTHER EVENT IN THE MODULE
//
//   * IT RUNS INSIDE A RAID BOSS ENCOUNTER. Everywhere else, DC events happen
//     BETWEEN fights. On a raid map DC stands down the moment an encounter goes
//     live and hands the fight to mod-playerbots' `bwl` strategy — and this
//     event is the single sanctioned exception, the one DungeonEvent::
//     encounterActive was written for. The raid fights the adds; DC works the
//     orb and the eggs; neither touches the other's job.
//   * ITS ACTOR IS NOT THE LEADER. Every other event is performed by the tank.
//     This one needs a DIFFERENT member — the orb refuses anyone with a pet, the
//     charmer is rooted for 90 seconds, and the tank is the only thing between
//     the raid and an add every four seconds. So the driver ELECTS a runner and
//     publishes it, and the runner walks itself to the orb on its own tick
//     (DungeonClearRazorgoreOrbAction). The leader's driver never pokes another
//     bot's movement — that tug-of-war is a solved-and-relearned lesson here.
//   * KILLING THE BOSS IS A WIPE. Razorgore dying in phase 1 casts 20038 and
//     instakills the raid, and DC owns that guard itself, in three layers because
//     one was not enough: DcTargetExclusionRegistry bars him from the DPS pool
//     while an egg stands, DungeonClearDpsTargetValue re-runs the pick when the
//     moon raid icon short-circuits that pool (which is what actually happened —
//     tr-20260827-233058-1, boss dead eight seconds after the pull, seventeen of
//     twenty-five bots dead with him), and DungeonClearHoldFireTrigger takes him
//     back off a bot that had already acquired him. This event's job is still to
//     make phase 1 END, which is the real fix; the guards buy it the time.
//
// VAELASTRASZ THE CORRUPT (boss 2) is the map's OTHER exception, and a much
// smaller one. He is a real boss with a real kill-bit, so the roster derives him
// for free and the playerbots `bwl` strategy already fights him (fire resistance,
// positioning, Burning Adrenaline step-outs). The single thing DC owes him is the
// OPENING: he lies friendly and passive at 30% health offering a gossip, and the
// raid starts the encounter by talking to him rather than by pulling him. So one
// conditional event does the talking, gated on the raid muster having finished —
// "when the raid is ready", which for a fight whose enrage timer starts the
// instant he turns is the whole point — and the boss-engage rung holds the raid
// where it stands from the muster through the ~63s of scripted intro, because
// everything it would otherwise do to him is either impossible (he cannot be
// attacked) or actively wrong (EngageDirect force-engages a non-hostile creature,
// which here would start the encounter with the boss still friendly and the intro
// never played).
//
// The other six BWL bosses need nothing here: all eight carry kill-credit rows
// (instance_encounters 610-617) so BossSpawnIndex derives the roster by itself.

    //      and the Suppression Rooms corridor passes within 36yd (2D) of the
    //      lever;
    //   2. the encounter bit, which reads DONE on a killed Chromaggus and is the
    //      authoritative end of this event even after the corpse decays;
    //   3. Chromaggus himself — caged (still IMMUNE_TO_PC) with the lever still
    //      selectable. Both halves matter and neither implies the other: a wiped
    //      attempt leaves him ATTACKABLE with the lever long since spent, and a
    //      click whose GossipHello reached the script leaves the lever spent on
    //      the tick before his immunity drops;
    //   4. THE MUSTER, read exactly as the rouse reads it. The gate is false
    //      while the muster runs, so the boss-engage rung (one rung below this
    //      one) keeps the tick and keeps advancing it; the tick it reaches Ready
    //      this flips true and the lever is pulled with the raid formed up.
    //
    // NOT gated on combat: there is none. He is walled off and immune, and the
    // instance only flips his encounter to IN_PROGRESS when he engages — which

// GRETHOK THE CONTROLLER IS BOSS #0 of this map. He carries no DungeonEncounter
// row and no kill credit — by the DBC he is trash — but he is what a human raid
// pulls to start Razorgore, and until this patch existed nothing in DC pulled him
// at all: a bespoke rung glided every bot to a staging point on the ledge the
// moment the leader came within 100yd, which is a footrace up a ramp with the
// tank at the front and the stragglers wherever the last trash pack left them.
//
// As a boss anchor he gets the whole ordinary pipeline for free — the advance
// walks the raid to him as one body, the raid muster (Boss anchors only) tops it
// off and rebuffs it, the boss standoff parks the tank just outside his aggro
// bubble, and the engage does the pull. That is the entire fix: no new movement
// code, and the pull that starts the encounter is the same pull every other boss
// in the module gets.
//
// COMPLETION borrows Razorgore's kill-bit (inheritCompletionFrom). Grethok has no
// bit of his own, and while he stands the candidate list holds him; his corpse
// drops him out on its own (present-but-dead), and Razorgore's kill covers the
// window after the corpse decays. The driver also latches the anchor cleared the
// moment the platform reads empty (BlackwingLairDriver) — that is the wipe path,
// where the corpse is long gone and the bit will not be set for another attempt.

// --- the Vaelastrasz -> Broodlord route ------------------------------------
//
// FORTY anchors, in two halves, and the split between them is the whole point of
// the row:
//
//   0-19   THE APPROACH. Vaelastrasz's chamber to the staging point, 317.5yd.
//          Nothing crosses a suppression room here; this is the ordinary walk the
//          clear has always made, and it is authored for one reason only — see
//          below.
//   20-39  THE CROSSING. The staging point (anchor TRANSIT_STAGE_ANCHOR_INDEX) to
//          the Broodlord standoff, 342.6yd across the two suppression rooms. This
//          is the transit's CURSOR TRACK, and BwlTransitRoute hands the driver
//          exactly this half so its anchor 0 is still staging.
//
// WHY THE APPROACH IS AUTHORED AT ALL, which is the S2043 lesson and cost four of
// five raids the leg. It used to start at the staging point, so the 162yd from
// Vaelastrasz's corpse to anchor 0 had no route — and Blackwing Lair FOLDS BACK
// OVER ITSELF: the upper suppression room sits ~41yd directly above Vaelastrasz's
// chamber, 82yd from it as the crow flies, while the staging point is 162yd away.
// The path cursor therefore projected a tank standing on Vaelastrasz's corpse onto
// anchor 19 — the STANDOFF, the far end of the crossing — and read the leg as
// nearly finished before the raid had walked a step. Resnap failed every tick
// (>45yd, `behind=true`), the rebuild re-ran every tick, the tank sat at
// `posDelta=0.00 gen=IDLE`, and where the party eventually blundered into the
// corridor bbox decided at random where the transit armed: one run of five armed
// at staging (13yd) and crossed in 9m50s; the other four armed 33-86yd away and
// took 18-24m, two of them walking clean past Broodlord's closed portcullis — the
// navmesh does not know a GameObject is shut — and killing Firemaw out of order.
//
// A polyline the party is standing ON has none of those failure modes: the cursor
// projects onto the leg it is actually walking, Resnap has something to snap to,
// and the transit arms at staging every time because the raid arrives there.
//
// Three separate consumers measure against this row and they must measure against
// the same thing: StridedPathfinder chunks the Broodlord approach along it, the
// transit driver runs its cursor down the second half, and the pack rung leashes
// every follower to the leg the leader is on.
//
// HOW IT WAS DERIVED, and how to re-derive it. Every point here is a decimation
// of the REAL Detour corridor: LongRangePathfinder's own core, run against the
// live map-469 mmtiles by t/TestBlackwingLairSuppressionRouteProbe, printed as
// an 87-point polyline and reduced (Douglas-Peucker at 2yd, then split so no
// leg exceeds ~24yd). The plan's hand-reconstructed coordinates are NOT what is
// here — that reconstruction bridged tile seams with a 5yd centroid stitch,
// which can invent a link across a railing, and a route that walks the raid into
// geometry with 160 whelps behind it is not a route. The probe re-prints the
// polyline on every run for exactly this reason: an mmaps regen that moves the
// corridor is re-authored from the print, not by hand.
//
// The certified shape, for reading the numbers against the room:
//
//   0-3    Vaelastrasz's chamber, south along its west wall at a flat z 409
//   4-5    the SWITCHBACK out of the chamber — the corridor doubles back on
//          itself and climbs 409 -> 424 in 20yd. Decimation must never cut this
//          corner: the straight line between its ends is inside the rock.
//   6-11   north up the long hall at a flat z 424.5
//   12-16  the bend northeast and the long straight, 428.5 -> 429.3
//   17-19  the hook east onto the staging shelf, 434 -> 438
//   20     THE STAGING POINT — anchor 0 of the crossing proper
//   20-22  the climb out of the Hall of the Dragonspawn, 437 -> 443 -> 441
//   23-25  south down the lower room's east wall at a flat z 440.8
//   26-29  the long diagonal southwest across the lower room, 440 -> 442
//   30-31  the TASKMASTER RAMP's foot. Six Blackwing Taskmasters stand at
//          (-7711,-1070,445) — 3.8yd off anchor 31. There is no running past
//          them, and their 600s respawn means killing them is progress.
//   32-33  over the crest into the upper room, 446 -> 451 -> 450
//   34-39  northeast up the upper room to the standoff, flat at z 449.8
//
// PIVOT_TIGHT on 4-5 and 31-33, and only there: those are the two places the
// corridor narrows to a chokepoint the raid has to file through, and a pack that
// fans out across one of them is a pack half of which is a floor behind.
