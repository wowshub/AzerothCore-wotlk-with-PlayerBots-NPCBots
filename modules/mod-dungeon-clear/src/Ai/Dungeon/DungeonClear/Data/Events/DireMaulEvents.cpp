// --- Dire Maul East (map 429) — Ironbark / Conservatory Door -------------
// Alzzin the Wildshaper's grove is sealed behind the Conservatory Door (GO
// 176907), which the party cannot open. Ironbark the Redeemed (14241), who
// stands at the west entrance corridor, opens it: pick his single gossip option
// (menu 5602, option 0) and his SmartAI walks him east along a 14-point path to
// the door and, ~7s after arriving, swings it open (and sets instance data
// TYPE_EAST_WING_PROGRESS=2), then despawns. Total gossip->open ≈ 20-30s.
//
// Anchored (not Conditional like Shadowfang Keep's twin courtyard door): when
// this becomes relevant the tank is ~190 yds away in the southern boss chamber
// (Zevrim/Hydrospawn/Lethtendris are reached WITHOUT the door; only Alzzin sits
// behind it). A Conditional Gossip step has no long-range navigation — it only
// HopTo's (raw MovePoint, 74-node capped) — which can't reliably cross that gap.
// An anchored OBJECTIVE gets the boss-nav LongRangePathfinder to deliver the
// tank to Ironbark first (BossRosterRegistry slots the objective at his spawn,
// ordered just before Alzzin); then this gossips him and waits for the door.
//
// No MoveTo to the door is needed: while WaitForGOState holds, the tank stays at
// Ironbark's anchor (west) and Ironbark walks east and opens the door himself.
// Holding the run here (relevance 31) also keeps the DC door machinery from
// prematurely force-opening the lock-free Conservatory Door (which would bypass
// Ironbark) or auto-pausing on the door-blocked timeout before the ~25s open. On
// completion boss-nav routes the tank through the now-open door to Alzzin.
//
// Persistent so a stray combat tick-gap can't rewind to step 0 and re-gossip —
// Ironbark removes his gossip npcflag on the first select, so a re-talk would
// find an empty menu and stall. SkipIfTargetMissing lets the gossip step skip
// once he has walked off / despawned; Optional degrades a non-firing script to
// the normal door-blocked stall (the door still opens, driven by his own AI).

    // --- Dire Maul North (map 429) — Gordok Courtyard & Inner Doors --------

    // shut: the Gordok Courtyard Door (GO 177219) at the front of the courtyard
    // and the Gordok Inner Door (GO 177217) before King Gordok's chamber. Both
    // are GAMEOBJECT_TYPE_DOOR with SmartGameObjectAI: a gossip-hello SET_INST_DATA
    // (TYPE_NORTH_WING_PROGRESS = 1 courtyard / 2 inner) and the door's own
    // On-Update GO_SET_GO_STATE(0) swings it to GO_STATE_ACTIVE; autoclose is off
    // so it stays open. GameObject::Use() fires the AI's GossipHello BEFORE any
    // lock/key check (GameObject.cpp), so a plain UseGO opens them — no key
    // needed, even though both carry GO_FLAG_LOCKED (which is precisely why the
    // stock DC door machinery won't auto-force them; this event is the only path).
    //
    // CONDITIONAL, not Anchored — these doors sit directly ON the corridor (the
    // tank walks straight into them while pursuing the next boss). An anchored
    // objective-arrive (relevance 30) CANNOT fire here: the shut door truncates
    // the route short of any anchor placed at it, so the bot never "arrives", and
    // the door-blocked stall (the blocking-door value flags a shut door up to
    // ~80yd ahead) parks the tank with "a closed door is blocking the path". The
    // door-blocked TRIGGER stands down only when a CONDITIONAL event is due
    // (relevance 31 > 22), so an on-path door MUST be conditional to preempt it.
    //
    // No nav steps are needed: the door-blocked action itself MoveTo-delivers the
    // tank up to the door before parking (see the door walk-in fix), so by the
    // time the condition fires the bot is already at the door. The condition scan
    // is kept TIGHT (~= the UseGO search radius) so door-blocked does that
    // delivery first; only once the bot is within reach does the condition go
    // true, door-blocked stands down, and UseGO closes the last few yards (HopTo)
    // and clicks. A wide scan would strand the bot — UseGO has no long-range nav.
    // Open state is GO_STATE_ACTIVE (0) here (unlike the East door, which Ironbark
    // opens to 2). Optional so a misfire degrades to the normal door-blocked stall.

    // PanelAfterBoss anchors each door to a North-wing boss: it sorts the panel
    // row sensibly (the courtyard door after the three southern guards, the inner

    // powered by five Crystal Generator pylons (BUTTON GOs). Each generator's
    // SmartGameObjectAI, once active, sets a bit in instance data TYPE_PYLONS_STATE
    // (field 2); at 0x1F (all five) the instance drops the field and clears
    // Immol'thar's (and the Highborne Summoners') NON_ATTACKABLE flag. The pylons
    // are scattered across the whole West wing — far beyond UseGO's HopTo range —
    // so each is a travel OBJECTIVE (BossRosterRegistry map-429 West patch,
    // OBJ(2..6)) that boss-nav delivers the tank to; this anchored event then
    // clicks it.
    //
    // ANCHORED (the objective-arrive drives it), not Conditional: there is no
    // door to preempt, and boss-nav must deliver the tank across the wing to each
    // pylon's anchor first. Persistent so a combat tick-gap at a guarded pylon
    // can't rewind the event to step 0 and re-click (the instance ORs the bit, so
    // a re-fire is idempotent, but re-clicking a spent BUTTON is best avoided).
    // The Wait(6000) covers the generator's ~5s SmartAI activation delay so the
    // bit is set before the tank moves on (and, on the last pylon, before it
    // reaches Immol'thar). Optional: a misfire degrades to the tank standing at
    // the still-shielded boss until the pylon is dealt with.
    //
    // Each event clears the crystal's guards/treants THEN clicks it — the proven
    // Uldaman keeper-altar pattern (ClearRadius -> MoveTo -> UseGO), NOT a bare
    // UseGO. The trick that makes "clear AND click" not deadlock is matching the
    // objective's arriveRadius to the ClearRadius (BossRosterRegistry sets the
    // crystal objectives' arriveRadius to 45, > this 40yd ClearRadius): while the
    // ClearRadius drives the tank around the clear zone chasing guards, the tank
    // stays within arriveRadius so the at-objective action keeps OWNING the tick
    // (relevance 30) and runs the event's steps in sequence. A small arriveRadius
    // (the old 10 vs a 50-70 ClearRadius) let the tank slip out of "arrived"
    // mid-clear, so engage-trash/Advance competed for the tick — the live
    // back-and-forth deadlock. Steps:
    //   0) ClearRadius(40): kill the ~7-8 elemental guards (Arcane Aberration
    //      11480 / Mana Remnant 11483; the Remnants Blink ~20yd, so 40 keeps a
    //      blinker in the kill zone) plus any treants within 40yd (at generator 1,
    //      the Warpwood entrance pack). Counts only REACHABLE hostiles, so a mob
    //      blinked somewhere unreachable can't hang it. 120s timeout backstop.
    //   1) MoveTo the crystal (radius 6): close the last yards via a fresh HopTo,
    //      so a long-range route that truncated short of the dais still reaches.
    //   2) UseGO: click the generator (sets the pylon bit ~5s later).
    //   3) Wait: cover that ~5s SmartAI activation delay before advancing.
    // Persistent so a combat tick-gap during the guard fight can't rewind to step
    // 0 and re-click. Optional so a stall degrades to moving on.
    //
    // NOTE (verify live): the generator trigger is SMART_EVENT_UPDATE (a timer),
    // not an explicit on-use event. If the generators auto-activate on spawn
    // rather than on click, the UseGO is a harmless no-op (the bit is idempotent).

    // FindPatch returns the FIRST patch matching a map, so all of Dire
    // Maul's wings share a SINGLE map-429 BossRosterPatch. Wing-filtering
    // (DungeonWingRegistry, applied after this) scopes each run to its
    // wing, so the East objective, the West reorder and the West pylon
    // objectives coexist here harmlessly — an East run never sees the
    // West adds and vice versa. orderOverride integers may therefore
    // repeat across wings (ordering is computed per wing).
    //
    // EAST — Conservatory Door objective. Alzzin's grove is sealed behind
    // the Conservatory Door (GO 176907), opened only by Ironbark the
    // Redeemed (14241) after a gossip. A travel OBJECTIVE at Ironbark's
    // spawn (wired to event 429/1) lets boss-nav deliver the tank to him;
    // the anchored event gossips him and waits for the door he walks off
    // to open. ANCHORED because the opener stands ~190yd OFF the corridor
    // (contrast the North Gordok / West Crescent doors, which sit ON the
    // corridor and so are CONDITIONAL — see DireMaulEvents.cpp). East
    // bosses reordered onto 10/20/30/50 with a gap (40) for the objective.
    //
    // WEST — order fix + Immol'thar pylons. The DBC encounter order does
    // not match the kill order, and Prince Tortheldrin (11486) must be
    // last: he is friendly/non-attackable until Immol'thar (11496) dies,
    // yet his chamber (y625) sits BEFORE Immol'thar (y812) on the walk.
    // Reorder so Immol'thar precedes the Prince. Immol'thar is held
    // NON_ATTACKABLE by a force field (GO 179503) until all five Crystal
    // Generators (pylons) are destroyed (the instance ORs a bitmask and
    // clears the flag at 0x1F). The five generators (BUTTON GOs) are
    // scattered wing-wide, far beyond HopTo range, so each is a travel
    // OBJECTIVE wired to a tiny anchored UseGO event (DireMaulEvents
    // 429/4..429/8) — the Sunken-Temple / Uldaman-altar pattern. Ordered
    // south-trio-before-Tendris / north-pair-before-Immol'thar to track
    // the route (pure orderOverride tuning if a backtrack looks bad live).
    // Engage of Immol'thar naturally waits on his NON_ATTACKABLE flag, so
    // no explicit "all pylons down" gate is needed. The objective
    // encounterIndex values are synthetic highs (40 East; 41-45 West
    // pylons) distinct from any real DBC kill-bit; objective completion
    // keys on the anchor latch (eventId), never on encounterIndex.
    //
    // NORTH — CHO'RUSH THE OBSERVER (14324, DBC bit 5) is SKIPPED. He carries a
    // real DungeonEncounter row, so BossSpawnIndex derives him as a boss, but on
    // this core he is never killable: his SmartAI (entryorguid 14324, id 19)
    // runs SMART_EVENT_UPDATE once 5s after spawn with NOT_REPEATABLE +
    // DONT_RESET and sets faction 35 — friendly to everyone, permanently. (The
    // On-Data-Set rows 16/18, the retail "surrender when King Gordok dies"
    // tribute mechanic, are redundant behind it.) Nothing the party does can
    // flip him back to attackable, so his kill-bit can never be set.
    //
    // Left in the roster he is the LAST anchor the North clear can reach — the
    // DBC order puts him on bit 5, before King Gordok on bit 38 — and the party
    // parks on him forever: run tr-20260816-061103-16 killed all six real North
    // bosses (King Gordok at 19:44) and then sat "Holding near Cho'Rush the
    // Observer" until the 60-minute wall-clock abort. Same shape as Maraudon's
    // Rotgrip (MaraudonEvents.cpp): an anchor the clear can never satisfy
    // deadlocks the run, so drop it rather than leave the fallback to chew on
