// A Conditional event's activation predicate: a pure-ish read-only test over the
// live world, evaluated each tick. When it returns true (and the event is not yet
// latched) the conditional-event trigger drives the event's steps. The predicate
// lives next to the event that uses it (one file per dungeon under Data/Events/,
// cross-dungeon shared predicates in SharedConditions.cpp) and is handed to the
// builder directly by pointer — there is no global id space to keep collision-
// free (a typo is now a compile error, not a silently-never-firing event).

// Declarative framework for scripted dungeon EVENTS the party must perform to
// progress — pull a lever, click an altar, talk to an NPC and pick a gossip
// option, walk to a spot to trigger a spawn, free a prisoner, etc. An event is
// PURE DATA: an ordered list of typed steps the DungeonEventExecutor drives one
// at a time. This replaces hand-written C++ in ObjectiveHookRegistry with a
// reusable step vocabulary (the old freeform hook survives as the `Custom` step).
//
// Authoring mirrors the other DungeonClear registries: a hardcoded table in a
// GLOB'd .cpp (link-safe in the static-lib build). See DungeonEventRegistry.cpp.
//
// Milestone 1 ships the anchored model + the low-risk steps. An anchored event
// is referenced by a travel-objective anchor (DungeonBossInfo::eventId, kind
// Objective): when the tank reaches the anchor the executor runs the event's
// steps to completion before the clear advances. Gossip and the conditional
// activation model land in later milestones (the enum carries their slots now).

    //      with no rotation while the DPS pulled aggro and died. The step still
