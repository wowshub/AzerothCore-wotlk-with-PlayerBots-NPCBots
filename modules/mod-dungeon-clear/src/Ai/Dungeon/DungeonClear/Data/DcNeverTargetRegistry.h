#include "Define.h"

// Static registry of creatures the CLEAR must never pick as a target.
//
// The clear's target selection — the corridor blocking-trash scan, the en-route
// pack sweep, the room-aggro pre-clear, a ClearRadius volume and the map-wide
// fallback pull — all gate their candidates on
// `AttackersValue::IsPossibleTarget`. That predicate answers "can this bot
// legally attack this unit right now", which is not the same question as "is
// killing this unit progress". A mob that is legally attackable but SCRIPTED
// NEVER TO DIE passes it every time, so the clear picks it, pulls it, fights it,
// watches it become invulnerable, and picks it again — a livelock with nothing
// for the pull FSM to key on: the target never dies and never goes away.
//
// This table is the "is killing it progress" half. A listed (mapId, entry) is
// dropped from every clear-side candidate set. It is NOT a pacifism switch: the
// stock combat engine's own targeting is untouched, so a bot these mobs attack
// still fights back normally. All this removes is the clear's decision to go
// LOOKING for them.
//
// Three kinds of mob qualify, and all three are about the same question:
//
//   1. IT CANNOT BE KILLED in the window the clear is walking through, so the
//      pull can never end in a kill and the scan re-picks it every tick (the
//      Nexus' Crystalline Frayer — the row this table was written for).
//   2. KILLING IT IS NEGATIVE PROGRESS: it is ENCOUNTER STAGING, placed by a
//      script around a fight the party is already in, and travelling to it drags
//      the party off the encounter (Ahn'kahet's Twilight Worshippers and
//      Volunteers, which the clear chased 52yd off Jedoga's ritual floor while
//      she was untargetable, resetting the encounter behind it).
//   3. THE RESPAWN RATE EXCEEDS ANY POSSIBLE CLEAR RATE, so the pack is INFINITE
//      BY CONSTRUCTION. Not "respawns eventually" — 160 spawns on a THIRTY-SECOND
//      timer across the 375yd the clear must cross is a spawn rate of 5.3/s. The
//      clear's pickers select the nearest one, walk to it, kill it, and select
//      its replacement; the room's population is a fixed point the party can
//      never move, and the clear's own driver is gated on nothing being engaged,
//      so the run does not slow down — it stops. The bar for this class is
//      ARITHMETIC, not annoyance: respawn interval x living population must make
//      "clear the corridor" unreachable AT ANY DPS. Blackwing Lair's Corrupted
//      Whelps are the row this class was written for and, so far, the only
//      content that meets it.
//
// Keep it small and keep the justification in the table. A mob that merely
// resists or heals does not belong here, and neither does ordinary trash that is
// simply inconvenient: class 2 is for mobs a SCRIPT spawns as part of an
// encounter the party must stay inside, and class 3 is a claim about a spawn
// rate that has to be shown, not asserted.
//
// Mirrors FightInPlaceRegistry / RoomAggroRegistry: adding a fix is a single
// table edit inside DungeonClear/, never a core change.
