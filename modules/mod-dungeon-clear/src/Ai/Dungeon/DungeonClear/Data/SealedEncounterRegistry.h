// Static registry of SEALED ENCOUNTERS: bosses whose room locks the moment the
// encounter starts, so anyone still outside is shut out of the fight for its whole
// duration.
//
// This is a real, scripted mechanic and not a guess. An instance script can register
// a door as DOOR_TYPE_ROOM against an encounter, and InstanceScript::UpdateDoorState
// then holds it `open &= (state != IN_PROGRESS)` — i.e. closed for exactly as long as
// the fight lasts. Magisters' Terrace does this for Selin Fireheart:
//
//   doorData[] = { GO_SELIN_DOOR (187979),           DATA_SELIN_FIREHEART, DOOR_TYPE_PASSAGE },
//                 { GO_SELIN_ENCOUNTER_DOOR (188065), DATA_SELIN_FIREHEART, DOOR_TYPE_ROOM    }
//
// 188065 is the Assembly Chamber Door, hanging at (215.1, 0.4) — the only way into
// Selin's room. Engage him and it shuts behind the tank. A follower that was still
// walking up the corridor never gets in: it stands at the door for the entire fight
// while the tank solos, which is what a run of this looked like from the outside.
//
// The ordinary readiness gate cannot catch this, and it is worth being precise about
// why rather than just tightening a number. DcPartyState::GetSpreadGate measures
// PartyMaxSpread (25yd) and, in pull mode between maneuvers, measures it against the
// CAMP rather than the tank — with a backstop of maxSpread + max(PullSetback,
// PullMaxDrag) = 60yd of permitted tank gap. Selin's camp is 71.6yd from him, so a
// tank that has walked to the doorway is ~45yd from the camp: comfortably inside every
// tolerance, with the whole party legitimately "set" back at the camp. Every gate
// passes and the door still shuts on four people.
//
// So a sealed encounter needs two things the generic path does not provide:
//
//   MUSTER   Nobody may be outside the room when the engage fires. Not "within N
//            yards of the tank" — that is a proxy, and a bad one here, because the
//            tank crosses the threshold before it engages, so a follower 10yd behind
//            it is 5yd on the WRONG SIDE of the door. The test has to be the volume.
//   CLUMP    A tighter, TANK-anchored spread gate on the final approach, so the party
//            is already at the tank's heels when it crosses instead of leapfrogging up
//            the corridor 25yd at a time. This is what makes the muster satisfiable
//            in a second or two rather than being a long wait inside aggro range.
//
// Both are scoped to the last stretch before the boss (`approachRadius`) so nothing
// about the rest of the run changes.

// On expiry the engage proceeds and whoever is outside stays outside — worse than
// mustering, still better than a dead run. Generous, because the cost of waiting is a
// few seconds and the cost of firing early is a member locked out of the whole fight.
