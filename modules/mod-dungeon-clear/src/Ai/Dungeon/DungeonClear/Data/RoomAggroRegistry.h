// Static registry of bosses that, on engage, force the surrounding ROOM into
// combat beyond ordinary social aggro — a scripted CallForHelp / grid-list
// AttackStart / SmartAI CALL_FOR_HELP bounded by a radius (± an entry
// whitelist). For these encounters the tank must clear the room BEFORE pulling
// the boss, or the group eats the whole pile when the pull goes off. See
// deployment-files/docs/mod-dungeon-clear_room-aggro-bosses_plan.md.
//
// One model only: the "room" is the script's own radius-sphere around the LIVE
// boss (some flagged bosses wander). Whole-instance pulls (SetInCombatWithZone
// on the boss itself) are deliberately NOT in this registry — a whole zone
// cannot be pre-cleared.

    // Tavarok, Y <= -145) are never pulled. Without this band the room-clear
    // chases those behind-the-boss adds it can never reach, orbits the boss, and
    // burns the whole RoomClearTimeout. The band is ABSOLUTE world Y, NOT relative
    // to the boss — he patrols, but the corridor that gets pulled is fixed.

    // the computed boss-aggro exclusion sphere (DcEngageGeometry::RoomAggroSphereRadius,
    // ~aggro+reaches+margins) used by DungeonClearRoomTrashValue to decide which
    // in-radius mobs "come with the boss": a mob is now excluded only if it sits
    // within THIS (smaller) radius of the boss, so a pack parked right on the boss's
    // aggro edge — normally swallowed by the exclusion and left for the boss pull —
    // is KEPT as clearable room trash. The Mechanar's Nethermancer Sepethrea is the
    // case: her front pack stands 17-19yd out, inside her ~28yd exclusion sphere.
    //
    // COUPLED WITH FORCED ADVANCED PULL — do not set one without the other. Shrinking
    // the exclusion below the skirt/standoff sphere is EXACTLY the "dead-band" the
    // room-trash value warns about (a pack KEPT as trash but UNREACHABLE by a straight
    // melee walk-in, because the skirt still avoids the real, wider sphere). It is
    // safe ONLY because a non-zero pullOutRadius also forces the room-clear to use the
    // advanced pull-to-camp maneuver (DcTargeting::RoomClearForcesAdvanced ->
    // DcPullPlanner): the tank forms up OUTSIDE the pack's own aggro (well outside the
    // real boss sphere), tags, and DRAGS the pack back to a cleared-ground camp,
    // never meleeing it in place inside the boss's wake radius. A Leeroy/legacy
    // room-clear on a mob inside the real sphere would dead-band or wake the boss, so
    // the two must move together. 0 => use the computed sphere (every other row).

    // keep OUTSIDE while pre-clearing this boss's room — the ring the approach
    // detour orbits, the tank's boss-engage standoff, AND (crucially) the clearance
    // the advanced-pull camp keeps from the boss so the dragged pack is FOUGHT
    // outside her aggro. When > 0 it WIDENS the computed
    // DcEngageGeometry::RoomAggroSphereRadius (max of the two) for this boss only.
    //
    // DECOUPLED FROM pullOutRadius on purpose. The computed sphere is sized off the
    // boss's raw aggro range; for a boss whose engage also fires a wide CallForHelp /
    // social pull (or who summons roamers that must not be fought on top of her), the
    // raw aggro under-states how far the fight must stay away. Widening the skirt does
    // NOT reclassify the kept close pack, because a row carrying a pullOutRadius uses
    // THAT (the small exclusion) for room-trash membership, never the skirt — so the
    // close pack stays clearable trash while the fight itself is dragged out to the
    // wider skirt. The Mechanar's Nethermancer Sepethrea is the case: Pack B is kept
    // as trash at pullOutRadius 14, but her Raging-Flames fight wants the open floor,
    // so the camp must stand well clear of her (skirtRadius 40) or killing Pack B in
    // her wake wakes the boss. 0 => use the computed sphere alone (every other row).

    // Optional absolute world-XY box every advanced-pull camp must stand inside

    // from the boss, and the drag walks it back along the trail, i.e. out of the
    // door the tank came in by. For a boss whose script evades when an add leaves
    // the room, or whose room door opens onto other packs, that walk must stop
    // short of the room's edge. Moroes is the case: his guests must stay at
    // x >= -11028, y >= -1955, and the south door leads to the Phantom
    // Attendants' corridor (tr-20260926-174359-2). hasCampBox == false (every
