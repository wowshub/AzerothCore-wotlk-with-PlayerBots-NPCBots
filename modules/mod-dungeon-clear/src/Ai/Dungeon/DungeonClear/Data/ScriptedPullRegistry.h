// Static registry of SCRIPTED PULL STAGES: hand-authored "peel this pack out of
// that room, in this order, from this exact spot" plans.
//
// It is the third member of the positional-override family and sits between the
// other two. FightInPlaceRegistry FORBIDS a pull; BossPullbackRegistry MANDATES
// one for a boss and hand-authors its camp. This one mandates a SEQUENCE of trash
// pulls and hand-authors both the camp AND the spot the tank takes the tag from.
//
// Why the extra spot. The generic pull picks its own commit point — it glides
// toward the pack and stops just outside the pack's aggro bubble. That works in a
// corridor, where "just outside aggro" and "out of everyone else's aggro" are the
// same place. It does not work in a room whose packs share sight-lines with each
// other and with a boss: there the only safe place to stand is a specific spot
// behind a specific piece of wall, which has line of sight to exactly one pack and
// to nothing else. That spot is not derivable from the navmesh or from aggro
// radii — it is a fact about the room's walls that a human measured in-game.
//
// The canonical case is Selin Fireheart's room (Magisters' Terrace, 585). Selin
// only ever attacks targets inside his room (CanAIAttack is
// `who->GetPositionX() > 216.0f`), his two six-mob guard packs sit either side of
// him well inside that plane, and every route that walks the party in far enough
// to fight a pack also wakes him. Seven sessions of trying to fight the packs in
// place, in a corner, ended with the boss pulled every time. The design this
// registry serves inverts it: the party camps WELL BACK DOWN THE HALL, and the
// tank steps to one measured spot per pack — both of them outside the room,
// shooting a diagonal through the doorway at the pack on the far side — tags at
// range, and drags it all the way back out. The party never enters the room until
// both packs are dead. See the MgT rows in ScriptedPullRegistry.cpp for the
// geometry.
//
// WELL BACK is doing work in that sentence, and the distance that matters is not to
// the doorway — it is 40 YARDS TO THE NEAREST GUARD SPAWN. Two of the six mobs in
// each pack are Wretched Husks, which cast 44503 Fireball / 44504 Frostbolt (both
// 40yd) off smart_scripts rows carrying castFlags 64, SMARTCAST_COMBAT_MOVE. The
// core reads that flag as "no combat movement while the target is in range AND in
// line of sight". So inside 40yd a Husk's answer to being pulled is to step clear of
// whatever was blocking line of sight and then PLANT and shoot — for this room, to
// stop in the doorway and hold the fight open across it. Outside 40yd it has no such
// option and must run the corridor, which is what a drag-back is for.
//
// The camp began ~20yd from the doorway, well inside that, and four rounds of fixes
// went into policing the consequences. It is now mid-corridor at 55yd from the
// nearest guard spawn, which buys three things at once, none of them a gate that can
// fail:
//   * THE CASTERS HAVE TO COME. See above; this is the whole reason for the number.
//   * SELIN CANNOT FOLLOW. An accidental boss tag used to mean a boss fight at the
//     camp; from 45yd under his CanAIAttack plane, a dragged Selin crosses it long
//     before he arrives, stops being able to attack anything, and resets. The worst
//     mistake available in this room becomes free.
//   * THE LEASHES STOP BEING LOAD-BEARING. A 12yd tank excursion covered ~60% of the
//     distance to the doorway before; now it covers 26%.
// What it costs is drag length — ~42yd instead of ~15 — so anything clocked against
// the short version has to be sized from the row instead of flat (see
// ScriptedPullTravelBudgetMs below and its two use sites), and the arm gate can no
// longer be measured from the camp at all (see `armX`).
//
// The SECOND plan on that map — the five-stage rotunda between Vexallus and
// Delrissa — is the same machinery solving a differently-shaped room, and it is
// worth knowing which parts of the above were about Selin specifically. There is no
// wall to hide behind there: it is one open circle holding five formations whose
// nearest members are 12-23yd apart, against a ~21yd elite aggro reach. So the
// separation a stand spot provides is DISTANCE, not line of sight, and it only
// exists relative to the packs that are still ALIVE when the spot is used. That
// makes `order` load-bearing in a way it is not for Selin's mirrored pair: every
// stage is approached across ground the previous stages emptied, and a stand spot is
// only ever checked against the packs LATER in the order. Reorder those rows and the
// coordinates stay valid while the plan stops working — which is why changing the
// order means re-deriving the spots, not just renumbering (it did, when the order
// became south -> centre -> east -> north-east -> north-west).
//
// It is also the plan that mostly does not tag at range. See `bodyPull` below: four
// of those five rows are authored as body pulls, so their stand spots are waypoints
// rather than firing positions and the distance that has to clear the still-live packs
// is measured from the AGGRO EDGE the tank walks on to, ~8yd past the spot. The EAST
// row is the exception — its neighbour is engaged at T=0 no matter what the opener is,
// so there is no separation for a body pull to buy and the row keeps the 8yd instead.
//
// A stand spot is measured in-game and cannot be sanity-checked by eye: the first
// west row here was, to two decimals on all three axes, the SPAWN POSITION OF ONE
// OF THE MOBS, and the plan dutifully walked the tank into the middle of the pack
// for four test runs while every gate downstream was patched around the symptom.
// Cross-check a new row against `creature` before trusting it — and against the
// navmesh, which is how the rotunda's first east spot was caught sitting outside the
// room's south-east wall. The row-geometry gtests in t/TestScriptedPull.cpp exist for
// exactly this.
//
// Everything after the plan is the EXISTING advanced-pull machinery, unchanged:
// the Forming/Advancing/Returning/Engage FSM, the follower hold-at-camp, the
// drag-back action. A stage only changes WHICH pack the pull is aimed at, WHERE
// the party camps, and WHERE the tank stands to tag.

    // The default is the opposite, and for a good reason: a ranged tag lets the tank
    // stand on the authored spot and stay there, which is the whole design of Selin's
    // rows. A body pull is what happens when no opener resolves, and the code has
    // always treated that as the degraded case.
    //
    // The rotunda inverts it, off live observation: pull most of those formations with
    // a ranged opener and the tagged pack brings NEIGHBOURS that the same pull taken by
    // body contact does not. That is not a wider CONFIG_CREATURE_FAMILY_ASSISTANCE_
    // RADIUS — that radius is a flat config drawn around the PULLED mob and is the
    // same either way — so this row does not try to out-measure it with geometry. It
    // forbids the opener instead, which is the one lever that reproducibly changes
    // which mobs come.
    //
    // The MECHANISM is worth knowing before setting this on a new row, because it
    // decides which rows it can help. CallAssistance fires twice over: once at T=0 from
    // the mob's SPAWN (engaging the neighbour 2000ms later), and then again every
    // CreatureFamilyAssistancePeriod — 3s — from wherever the mob is standing by then,
    // for the whole fight. Only the second kind is opener-dependent, because only it
    // samples a position the pull style can change. So this flag buys separation for a
    // pair that is a NEAR MISS at spawn and would have been caught by a later re-call,
    // and buys nothing at all for a pair that is already inside at T=0. The rotunda's
    // east/north-east pair is the second kind, which is why that row is ranged: see the
    // cross-pack margin table in ScriptedPullRegistry.cpp.
    //
    // What it costs is the stand spot's original job. On a ranged row the spot is a
    // FIRING POSITION and the tank never leaves it (DC_SCRIPTED_PULL_CREEP is 0). On a
    // body-pull row it is a WAYPOINT: the tank walks to it, and then walks on to the
    // aggro edge of its own pack — about 8 more yards, in a direction the spot chose.
    // So the number a body-pull row is authored against is not "is the nearest member
    // inside 30yd" but "is the point 18-19yd from the nearest member still clear of
    // every pack this plan has not pulled yet". See the rotunda dossier in
    // ScriptedPullRegistry.cpp for those five measurements, and
    // RotundaBodyTagPointsClearEveryStillLivePack in t/TestScriptedPull.cpp for the
    // assertion that keeps them true.
    //
    // Two things downstream key on this, both in DcPullActions' Advancing branch, and
    // both already existed as the no-opener fallback path:
    //   * the stand-spot CLAMP on the walk-in is dropped, so the tank may cross the
    //     8yd from the spot to the aggro edge;
    //   * the generic bystander detour is restored, because there is no longer an
    //     authored firing lane for it to bend the tank off.
    // The third is new and is only needed once a body pull is the PLAN rather than a
    // fallback: the walk-to-the-stand-spot leg has to stop re-issuing itself once the
    // tank has arrived (DcPullContext::scriptedAtStandMs), or the two legs fight —
    // forward to the aggro edge, back to the spot, forward again.

    // one the opener can actually reach) and a defensible one for a body pull (the
    // shortest walk in). It is the wrong answer when the pack has a NEIGHBOUR that is
    // going to come anyway, because then the only quantity worth optimising is how far
    // that neighbour has to run before it arrives.

// Measured, from the EAST stand spot (212.22, 7.42) — the numbers the original row
// comment worked through for the west spot and never did for this one:
//   centre-pair Skulker 96825 (231.70,  2.63)   20.06yd
//   centre-pair Bruiser 96830 (231.62, -1.86)   21.50yd
// A level-69 elite reaches ~19yd against a level-70, so the spot itself clears them
// by about a yard. Creep 2.5yd toward the east pack and the tank stands at
// (213.34, 5.19): 18.54yd from that Skulker — inside aggro — and the sight-line to it
// now leaves the doorway at Y~4.8 instead of Y~6.5, i.e. through the opening instead
// of into the wall. The creep shortens the range AND opens line of sight, and
// tr-20260803-133734-1 is what that looks like: the tank body-pulled both centre mobs
// on the first pull, which is a fight the plan never accounted for right next to the
// boss.
//
// Nothing is lost by removing it. Both packs' nearest member is inside a 30yd opener
// from its own spot (east ~25yd, west ~27.8yd), so the slack was never needed here,

// --- holding the fight at the camp ---------------------------------------
// A drag-back ends the moment the TANK is home, on a scripted stage exactly as on an
// ordinary trash pull: arriving IS the end of the maneuver, and the flip to Engage
// releases tank and party together.
//
// It briefly did not. Because the tag is taken at range from a stand spot, the pack
// starts its run ~42yd out and the tank is home several seconds ahead of it, and a
// GATHER radius held the tank on the camp until every live attacker had run in — on
// the theory that stock combat, handed a victim that far away, would chase it back
// into the room. But the drag is what empties the room: by the time the tank stands
// on the camp the whole pack is loose in the corridor behind it, so the chase that
// gate feared is a chase down open hallway, not into the room. Meanwhile the hold
// cost a real thing — the tank standing still, back to an inbound six-mob pack,
// building no threat while the released DPS opened on the runners.
//
// So ONE gate scoped to a scripted stage remains:
//
//   LEASH   for the whole camp fight, how far the tank may stray from camp before it
//           is walked back. Generous on purpose: it exists to catch a chase
//           excursion, not to fight the tank's own footwork. It used to have to stay
//           inside the ~20yd from camp to the doorway; with the camp 45yd back that
//           ceiling is slack. This — not an arrival hold — is what keeps the tank off
//           the doorway, and it applies for the entire fight rather than just its
//           first seconds.
//
// IT IS SIZED BY THE STEP-OUT, NOT BY THE FOOTWORK. It was 12yd — "planted, with
// footwork" — and that number is wrong the moment a ground effect lands ON the camp,
// because then the two rungs driving the bot are asking for incompatible places and
// neither ever wins:
//   * the generic avoid-aoe hops min(radius + 1, AiPlayerbot.FleeDistance) = 5yd from
//     wherever the bot is standing, and CheckLastFlee then forbids reversing that hop
//     for 5s — so a bot hauled back does not settle, it re-hops SIDEWAYS;
//   * MgT's Magic Dampening Field step-out is stricter still: it only accepts a spot
//     that clears every field by DAMPENING_CLEAR (9yd), off rings of 7/10/13/16yd
//     around the bot.
// And the bot doing the stepping is not standing on the camp anchor when the field
// lands — it is in melee on something that reached the camp, i.e. already ~5yd out.
// That puts the generic hop at ~10yd from camp and a dampening escape at ~14yd, both
// outside a 12yd leash. So EVERY legal step-out tripped the recall, the recall walked
// the bot back into the effect, and the effect pushed it out again. That is the
// ping-pong the player watched: not a chase, two correct rungs with contradictory
// destinations, neither of which can yield.
//
// 14 is that worst case with a yard of slack, and it is deliberately NOT the 18 this
// number was first set to. The leash is not just a ceiling on an excursion — with the
// release band below it also sets where the tank FIGHTS, and every yard of it is spent
// permanently, on every camp fight, whether or not anything was ever dropped on the
// camp. At 18/10 the tank's steady state was 10-20yd forward of the authored camp:
// live, one Selin camp fight logged seven leash trips (18.0, 18.1, 18.6, 19.0, 19.3,
// 20.8, 22.7yd) in under a minute, and eighteen across five minutes of play. That is
// the reported "tank runs forward" — not the walk-in, the camp fight.
//
// The ping-pong this constant was widened for is fixed by the two rungs that landed
// with it and not by the width: the recall RELEASES at DC_SCRIPTED_PULL_RECALL_HOME
// (outside any field centred on the camp) instead of marching the tank back onto the
// anchor, and a recall is dropped outright while the bot stands in a ground effect. 12
// already cleared both step-out bounds the tests pin; 14 keeps a 4yd band above the
// release so the latch cannot arm and clear on the same tick.
//
// It stays far short of what the plans need it to be short of: Selin's
// camp-to-doorway gap, and the 40yd of caster range every rotunda row keeps between
// its camp and every still-live pack. Both are pinned in t/TestScriptedPull.cpp.

// back in, and it spent the fight walking instead of casting. That is what "the party
// never settles to dps or heal" looks like from the outside.
//
// 12 is a melee follower already ~5yd out on its mob plus the generic hop, and clear

// easily sit 40-45yd from a camp the tank is planted on, and a 28.5yd spellDistance
// then makes the leash and the shot mutually exclusive: the follower walks out, gets
// in range, is recalled, and is out of range again the moment it arrives.
//
// Live (tp-20260808-211456-1), one hunter, one cycle, verbatim:
//     assist camp: LOS, out of range (40.3yd) -> yield to stock reach

// it can be broken.
//
// Live (tr-20260803-144046-4): the tank reached the camp, logged "back on the camp
// (4.5yd) -> fighting", and then said NOTHING for four minutes and thirteen seconds
// — Engage for 254s with three members combat-flagged, every victim empty and every
// health bar at 100%. The pack was on somebody's attacker list and nothing was
// happening. The run was still in that state when it was killed by hand.
//
// PROGRESS, NOT WALL CLOCK. A camp fight's length is set by the pack and the party's
// damage, not by any distance the row authored, so there is no honest budget to size
// it against — and a flat ceiling generous enough for a slow six-mob heroic pack
// (tr-20260803-144046-8 spent 137s on one stage) is too generous to catch a freeze
// quickly. Watching the pack's summed health instead separates the two outright: a
// fight that is happening moves it within seconds, so a legitimate fight of any
// length re-arms the clock over and over and can never trip. Only a fight that has
// actually stopped runs the window down.
//
// 45s of a heroic pack's health not moving by even a percent is not a slow fight, it

// --- the camp that walks forward -------------------------------------------------
//
// A CAMP IS ONLY A CAMP IF THE FIGHT CAN HAPPEN AT IT, and against one class of mob it
// cannot. AzerothCore's SmartAI has a RANGE MODE: SmartAI::InitializeAI takes the
// first SMARTCAST_COMBAT_MOVE cast a creature owns (there is no SMARTCAST_MAIN_SPELL
// anywhere on this trash) and calls SetMainSpell, which sets
//   _attackDistance = spellMaxRange - NOMINAL_MELEE_RANGE
// and then chases with MoveChase(victim, _attackDistance). ChaseRange(float) has
// MinRange 0, so such a mob never backs away — but it never closes past that distance
// either. It stands there and shoots. For the rotunda that is:
//
//   Sunblade Magister  Frostbolt 44606      40yd -> stands off at 35yd
//   Sunblade Warlock   Immolate 44518       30yd -> stands off at 25yd
//   Coilskar Witch     Forked Lightning 20299 30yd -> stands off at 25yd
//
// Every one of those is outside DC_SCRIPTED_PULL_LEASH (14) and well outside
// DC_SCRIPTED_PULL_FOLLOWER_LEASH (12). So a camp fight whose last live member is one
// of them is unwinnable BY CONSTRUCTION, and it fails in a very particular way: the
// tank's rotation chases the only thing it can see, trips the leash at 14, is recalled
// to the 10yd release band, yields the tick, and chases again — while the followers,
// pinned at 12, log "LOS, out of range" or "no-LOS" at it and never fire.
//
// Live (tr-20260808-211502-8, the north-east row): 42 leash trips between 21:29:38 and
// 21:32:05, every one of them 14.1-14.8yd out and back to 9.5-10.0, with the pack's
// health frozen at 88% the whole time — one Sunblade Magister, alive and untouched,
// standing where nobody was allowed to go. 218 trips across that plan's twenty runs.
//
// THE ANSWER IS TO MOVE THE CAMP, NOT TO LENGTHEN THE LEASH. Widening the leash was
// tried and reverted (see DC_SCRIPTED_PULL_LEASH: at 18/10 the tank's steady state
// moved 10-20yd forward of the authored camp on EVERY camp fight, whether or not
// anything was ever standing off). And it would not even work here — 35yd of stand-off
// is not a leash length any camp can afford. What a human tank does instead is walk up
// to the caster and hold there, and the party moves up with them.
//
// SO THE CAMP WALKS, along the camp->stand-spot segment and no further. The stand spot
// is the one forward point on this row that the plan has already reasoned about: it is
// authored ~26yd from the pack and cleared against every pack the plan has not pulled
// yet (the margins table in each row's comment), and the tank has already walked to it
// once this pull to take the tag. Anything past it is ground nobody measured.
//
// Step size. One leash-band per trip: far enough that a step is worth taking (a 35yd
// stand-off needs two or three of them), small enough that the party never jumps a
// whole room on one bad sample. The clamp to the segment is what bounds the total.

// after we have already walked the camp to the stand spot is the admission that the
