    // where an unconditional raycast would not pay for itself. Failing the

    // fallback — a PathGenerator route, wall-safe AND floor-safe by construction,
    // so it routes AROUND whatever the chord tried to cross.

    // TWO probes, because a wall and a hole fail differently. LegIsClear is a

    // Colossus arena, opening leg straight across the x 1638-1648 void, LOS
    // clean — 202yd walked for 0.98yd of net progress, 142 direction reversals,
    // and a stuck ladder that ran to completion nine times without ever
    // suspecting the route (which was fine) or the leg (which nothing checked).
