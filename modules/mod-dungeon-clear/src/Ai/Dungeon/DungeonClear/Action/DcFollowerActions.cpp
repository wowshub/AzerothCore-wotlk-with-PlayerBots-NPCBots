    // down to follow-tank — which walks it 17yd back down the corridor to the
    // snared tank, out of the band again, so the pack rung re-arms and walks it
    // forward. In that run 114 follower moves inside the crossing corridor went
    // BACKWARDS along the route; the trail branch below was logging on every one
    // of them (80% of its moves went backwards, median 17.4yd), while the pack

    //
    // It also starved the crossing it was undoing. The driver's advance gate is a
    // quorum on the followers' distance to the CURSOR, so dragging them off the
    // cursor is precisely what kept `pack trailing` holding 217 of 310 ticks.

    // whichever one that walk reached first while we had walked to the one DcRez
    // Decision::PickTarget chose (healer, then tank, then group order). The two
    // agreeing was luck, and when they disagreed the cast simply failed the range
    // check on a body we were nowhere near, silently, every tick.

    // A false return (out of mana, LOS lost on the settle) yields the tick so the
    // lower rungs — drink/eat at 26.5 — run; the recovery timeout backstops a rezzer
    // that never affords the cast.

    // as CastReviveAction::getPrerequisites does. No-op for everyone else. (Same
    // mechanism as DcFormGate, which gates items rather than spells.)
