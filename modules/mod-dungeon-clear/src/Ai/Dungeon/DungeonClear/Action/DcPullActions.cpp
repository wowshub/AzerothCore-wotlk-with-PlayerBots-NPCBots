//             range+LOS, else it closes to body-tag. The moment combat starts,

        //     of that leg — PullCommitRange deliberately Forms the tank a hair
        //     outside the pack's real bubble, so the first few yards of the walk-in
        //     are what trip it — and the instant the tank is in combat the
        //     non-combat pull trigger goes silent. Nobody cancels the move, so the
        //     MotionMaster happily finishes carrying the tank INTO the pack while
        //     the engine flip is happening.
        //
        //  2. The LastMovement block. Before mod-playerbots #2747 that same MoveTo
        //     recorded a delay window sized to the whole leg's travel time at
        //     MOVEMENT_COMBAT priority; after it only an explicit hold blocks (and
        //     DC's own SplinePath records one). Either way the arbiter refuses a
        //     new move whose priority is not STRICTLY GREATER than the recorded
        //     one, so the

        //     remainder of that budget. The maneuver still returns true (it owns

        // Hold clears (1): it kills a coasting glide, and no-ops when the tank is

        // otherwise skip, and the half that actually blocks the retreat. Deliberately

    // the CC clears) and engages the pack where it stands, and the phase flips to
    // Engage — which both drops the party's passive camp-hold and trips
    // IsLeaderCampFightActive so the followers pile onto the pack and help. The

    // otherwise-fine pull away.

    // A SCRIPTED stage does not take the abort, but it does take HALF of it.

    // piles in" — right when the ground under the tank is ordinary corridor, and
    // catastrophic when the plan exists precisely because that ground is not
    // survivable. Selin's room is the case: a slow read mid-drag aborted the pull,
    // the tank turned and fought the pack back at its own spawn (228.2,-21.0), and
    // the whole room came with it (tr-20260802-215715-3). So a scripted drag keeps
    // dragging, bounded by the return-leg watchdog below.
    //
    // But "keep dragging" is only an answer while the tank is ACTUALLY DRAGGING. The
    // suppression was written against a SLOW, which still walks the pack home — just
    // slowly — and it swept a hard stun in with it, where the tank covers no ground
    // at all and simply stands in the pack. Live (tr-20260808-211502-15, the rotunda
    // south row, whose authored body-pull target IS a Sister of Torment): tag at
    // 21:26:34, Deadly Embrace (44547 — 6s stun plus ~500 a tick, fired exactly 3s
    // after the pack enters combat, and the solo puller is the only thing on its
    // threat list) landed at 21:26:41 with 22.1yd still to run, and the tank was dead
    // at 21:26:47 with the party still passive at a camp it never reached. The same
    // row killed the same tank three times in a row.
    //
    // So on a scripted stage a hard CC RELEASES THE PARTY without touching the pull
    // (DcPullContext::SafetyRelease — the camp-safety valve's "let them fight, don't
    // abandon the maneuver" half). The drag survives, so the fight still ends up at

        // THEN: the tank does not reach the camp until it has dragged the pack the
        // whole way out of the room and down the corridor, so at the moment of arrival
        // every mob that matters is loose in the hall, behind it, and safe to fight.

        // tick — opened on the runners. Threat starts on whoever shot first, which is
        // the opposite of what a tank's arrival at the camp is for.

        // So arrival is the end of the maneuver here exactly as it is for an ordinary
        // trash pull: stop, flip to Engage, and that flip releases the party. They stay
