// The Black Morass wave driver — the imperative half of map 269's clear.
//
// This is the one encounter whose on-arrival behaviour is not an ACTION but a
// CONTROLLER. Every other ObjectiveHookRegistry hook does a thing once on
// arrival (fire a cannon, grant an item, poke an NPC) and returns Running only
// while it waits for a latch to confirm the thing took. BmDriveWave instead
// re-decides from live world state every tick for the whole length of a timed,
// losable encounter, and to do that it owns three layers the event framework
// normally supplies:
//
//   * MOVEMENT   — BmTravelTo / BmGarrison / the repath epsilon and reissue
//                  throttle. The driver sets StepsOwnMovement (which strips the
//                  driving action's per-tick ResolveEscortConflict, because that
//                  hold was cancelling the driver's own spline), so it owns the
//                  whole glide lifecycle including cancelling it on delivery.
//   * ENGAGEMENT — BmEngageTarget / BmForcePull. Rift adds spawn REACT_DEFENSIVE
//                  and park at a home 14yd from Medivh, so they never aggro and
//                  the normal engage pipeline cannot see them.
//   * SELECTION  — BmSelectTargetRift / BmKeeperOf / BmDrainersOnMedivh, over
//                  three disjoint entry classes with different kill semantics.
//
// That is ~370 lines of machinery before either hook body, which is why this
// lives in its own translation unit rather than in ObjectiveHookRegistry.cpp
// alongside the one-shot arrival actions. The DECLARATIVE half of map 269 (event
// rows, conditions, roster patch, and the shared drainer/keeper entry lists this
// file consumes) stays in Data/Events/BlackMorassEvents.cpp, per the one-file-
// per-dungeon rule in DungeonEventTables.h.

{
    // === The Black Morass (map 269) — CoT: Opening of the Dark Portal ======
    //
    // THE ENCOUNTER, from the core scripts (instance_the_black_morass.cpp +
    // the_black_morass.cpp), because every rule below falls out of it:
    //
    //  * A Time Rift (17838) opens. +6s it summons its KEEPER (a Rift Lord /
    //    Rift Keeper, or on waves 6/12/18 the bosses Deja / Temporus / Aeonus).
    //    +16s, and every 15s after that FOREVER, it summons one trash add.
    //  * Every add is spawned REACT_DEFENSIVE and sent (DoSummonAtRift ->
    //    SetHomePosition + MoveTargetedHome) to a home 14yd from Medivh, where it
    //    RESETS and casts Corrupt on itself; the aura ticks SetData(
    //    DATA_DAMAGE_SHIELD) and Medivh's 100% shield falls. 0% loses the run.
    //  * npc_time_rift::SummonedCreatureDies despawns the rift the instant its
    //    keeper dies. KILLING THE KEEPER IS THE ONLY SHUTOFF FOR THE ADD PUMP.
    //  * Close the only open rift and the next opens in 1s; leave it open and the
    //    next opens anyway at 90s (2min from rift 13), up to 4 concurrent.
    //
    // So the whole encounter reduces to one quantity — open rifts x 15s = adds
    // produced — and to one strategy, which is exactly how a human party plays it:
    //
    //      hold ON Medivh (every add walks to him, so it is the one spot that
    //      intercepts all four rifts with zero travel) -> when Medivh's ring is
    //      clean, run to the open rift and kill its KEEPER, picking up the adds
    //      that spawn on top of you -> the rift closes -> run back and clean up
    //      whatever leaked -> next rift.
    //
    // HISTORY — why this is one decision hook and not a step list. The previous
    // shape was a 17-step sequential event (camp -> nine per-entry drainer kills
    // -> four portal volumes -> Medivh -> arena) fronted by an arena-wide
    // force-pull. Three failures were structural to that shape, and all three are
    // the reason a run "fell apart once two portals were open":
    //
    //  1. The whole thing was driven only OUT OF COMBAT (the conditional-event
    //     rung stands down on bot->IsInCombat()). This is a continuous wave fight;
    //     with two rifts pumping, combat never dropped, the driver never ran, and
    //     the tank simply stood where its last fight ended. Fixed at the framework
    //     — the wave event is flagged DrivesInCombat() and a combat-engine copy of
    //     the rung (DcRel::EventDueCombat) drives it under fire.
    //  2. The keeper — the only shutoff — sat BEHIND nine drainer-kill gates that
    //     a live rift re-blocked every 15s, so it was never reached and no rift
    //     ever closed. A sequential step list cannot express "always prefer the
    //     keeper"; it can only express "do these in order and block".
    //  3. The arena-wide force-pull ran FIRST, so it dragged the whole arena into
    //     combat and then the (non-combat) driver went dormant — a combat-lock
    //     generator in front of the only useful work.
    //
    // The force-pull ITSELF was a correct discovery and is kept below: the adds
    // are REACT_DEFENSIVE and parked in a reset/home idle, so they never aggro the
    // party and DcTargeting's selector (via AttackersValue::IsPossibleTarget)
    // cannot see them either — the party stands on top of a mob draining the
    // shield and does nothing. It is now a SIDE EFFECT scoped to what the party is
    // already next to, and it never gates and never redirects the tank.

    //    aggro and the party wiped.

    //    and re-enter combat, over and over.

    // Two things must both be true for the normal pipeline to pull one of the rift
    // adds, and neither is:
    //
    //  1. It will not aggro US. DoSummonAtRift spawns it REACT_DEFENSIVE and sends
    //     it to a home 14yd from Medivh, where it RESETS and casts Corrupt on
    //     itself. Defensive + at home + never damaged = it stands there
    //     indefinitely with the party in melee range.
    //  2. We do not reliably pull IT. EngageDirect ends with bot->Attack(), whose
    //     own comment concedes it "doesn't reciprocate combat until a swing lands
    //     — which stock combat targeting can drop the target before". It HAS a
    //     deterministic force-pull for exactly this, creature->EngageWithTarget(),
    //     but that call is gated `if (!bot->IsHostileTo(creature))` on the
    //     reasoning that a red-name hostile aggros on its own. These are red-name
    //     hostiles that do NOT aggro on their own — the one case that misses.
    //
    // Deliberately NOT fixed by loosening the shared gate in EngageDirect, nor by
    // loosening AttackersValue::IsPossibleTarget (which is why DcTargeting's
    // selector reports the volume empty while the party stands on the mob): both
    // are shared by every dungeon's engage path and their strictness is
    // load-bearing elsewhere. Scoped here to map 269 and to these entries instead.
    //
    // EngageWithTarget adds forced threat (or SetInCombatWith for a threat-less
    // unit), which pulls the mob out of its reset idle and hands it to the normal
    // combat engine; AttackStart makes its SmartAI actually swing rather than
    // merely hold threat. From that point it is an ordinary hostile and every
    // downstream gate sees it.
    // Point the TANK at `target` and start swinging.
    //
    // BmForcePull below is the other half of a pull and is not a substitute for
    // this one: EngageWithTarget/AttackStart make the CREATURE attack the BOT, and
    // nothing in that direction ever gives the bot a victim. A player does not
    // auto-retaliate — something has to call Player::Attack. Normally that is
    // stock combat's own targeting, but the driver has to be sure the tank commits
    // to the KEEPER specifically (it is the objective; everything else at the
    // portal is noise), and to commit on the tick it arrives rather than whenever
    // stock targeting next re-picks.
    //
    // Mirrors the in-range tail of DungeonClearEngageActionBase::EngageDirect

    // stopping, so the ride simply continued to the end of the line.

    // after one dies — and it cheerfully walks the tank straight back off the

    // that gap, which is the entire point of camping it.
