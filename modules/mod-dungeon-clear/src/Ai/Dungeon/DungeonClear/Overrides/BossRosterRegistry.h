// Per-dungeon corrections to the auto-derived boss list (BossSpawnIndex).
//
// Many dungeons spawn a boss only after an event, gate a boss behind an event
// the party must travel through, or simply carry the wrong creature in their
// DungeonEncounter.dbc data. This registry lets each such dungeon express a
// small PATCH against the derived list — remove the wrong/locked entries, add
// the real boss (with hand-authored navmesh coords), and/or add travel
// "objective" anchors the tank leads the party to.
//
// Authoring is one row per dungeon in a hardcoded table (see
// BossRosterRegistry.cpp), mirroring RoomAggroRegistry. This is link-safe in
// the static-lib build (a hardcoded table in a GLOBed .cpp), unlike
// self-registering static initializers which the linker strips.

    // DBC encounter order doesn't match the sensible travel path WITHOUT
    // remove+re-add (no hand-authored coords needed — the auto-derived spawn
