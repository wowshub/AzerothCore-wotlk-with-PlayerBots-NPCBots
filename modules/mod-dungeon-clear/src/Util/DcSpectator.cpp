/*
 * mod-dungeon-clear — DcSpectator.cpp
 *
 * See DcSpectator.h for the design and the Free-vs-Follow split.
 *
 * Free mode's load-bearing detail: the possess branch of Unit::SetCharmedBy
 * sets UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_MOVE on the CHARMER (the player body). Nearly every
 * MotionMaster entry point refuses a UNIT_FLAG_DISABLE_MOVE owner — including
 * the two DungeonClear uses, MovePoint (MotionMaster.cpp:488) and
 * MoveSplinePath (MotionMaster.cpp:506) — so without clearing that flag the bot
 * body freezes solid the moment the camera detaches. We clear it immediately
 * after a successful possess; it is a one-time set (nothing re-asserts it
 * during possession), and RemoveCharmedBy clears it again on teardown, so the
 * early clear is harmless on exit.
 *
 * Follow mode's load-bearing detail: Player::SetViewpoint stores the seer in
 * PLAYER_FARSIGHT via AddGuidValue, which REFUSES to overwrite a non-empty
 * field. Possession also parks the dummy there (SetClientControl ->
 * SetViewpoint). So the two modes can never be applied on top of one another —
 * every entry point tears the other down first, and ClearViewpoint below
 * force-clears the field when the watched unit has vanished, because
 * SetViewpoint(obj, false) needs a live object to hand back.
