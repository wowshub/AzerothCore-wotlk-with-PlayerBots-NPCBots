// The scripted-pull plans on Magisters' Terrace (585): Selin Fireheart's room
// (orders 0-1) and the Delrissa rotunda (orders 2-6).
//
// Everything here is geometry the plans are only correct BECAUSE of — the pack
// cylinders sized to hold their own spawns and exclude their neighbours, the arm
// radius sized to sit between the last trash and the room, and the stage ordering.
// A row edit that breaks any of it produces a run that looks healthy in the log and
// pulls the boss, which is exactly the failure mode seven previous attempts at
// Selin's room died of. So it is pinned here rather than left to a live run to
// discover.
//
// The two plans want different things asserted, because the rooms are different
// shapes: Selin's pair is separated from the boss by a WALL, and its tests are about
// sight-lines through a doorway. The rotunda's five are separated from each other by
// DISTANCE alone, and its tests are about which packs are still alive at each stage.
// Use RowsFor(boss) rather than Rows(MGT) for anything that is really about one room.
