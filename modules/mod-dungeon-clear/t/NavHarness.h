class dtNavMesh;

// Tier-2 standalone navmesh routing harness (headless-sim plan). Loads a map's
// Detour navmesh straight from a sliced mmaps directory (no worldserver, no DB,
// no creatures, no live Player/Map) and runs the DC long-range A* against it via
// LongRangePathfinder::BuildCoreFromMesh — which is explicitly worker-safe: it
// takes a raw dtNavMesh* and floats and touches NO live game state. That is what
// makes the routing half of DC testable offline: the geometry bug class
// (ledge/under-map/island/reachability) is a pure function of navmesh + coords.
//
// Map data is client-derived and NEVER committed; the slice lives under a
// gitignored mapdata dir produced by tools/slice_mapdata.py. When the slice for
// a map is absent, LoadMap returns nullptr and the test GTEST_SKIPs.
//
// NOT covered here: closed-door GO-LOS (the navmesh is baked door-blind, and a
// shut door is a runtime GameObject, not static geometry) — that needs a live
// GameObject and belongs to the live smoke tier, out of scope for this harness.
